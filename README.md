# SPARQL Query Translator: DBpedia to Wikidata

## Overview
This repository aims to develop a workflow for translating SPARQL queries from **DBpedia** to **Wikidata**, using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The project explores the challenges of query translation between different knowledge graphs and evaluates the approaches used, with a focus on error classification to gain deeper insights into solving certain issues.

## Goals
1. **Translation Workflow:** Create a robust system to translate SPARQL queries from DBpedia to Wikidata.
2. **Evaluation:** Assess the effectiveness of the translation approaches through quantitative and qualitative analysis.
3. **Error Analysis:** Classify and analyze translation errors to better understand the challenges and inform future improvements.

## Features
- **LLM-Powered Translation:** Utilize LLMs to bridge the syntactic and semantic differences between DBpedia and Wikidata SPARQL queries.
- **Automated Testing:** Evaluate the translated queries against real knowledge graph endpoints.
- **Error Categorization:** Systematically identify and classify translation errors for better debugging and refinement.
