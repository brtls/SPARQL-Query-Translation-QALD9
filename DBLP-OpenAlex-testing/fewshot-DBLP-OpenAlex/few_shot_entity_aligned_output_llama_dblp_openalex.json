        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) based on the given information, we need to map the DBLP query to the OpenAlex query. From the ER2 mapping, we see that the corresponding relation in OpenAlex for authoredBy is hasAuthorship, and the corresponding relation for the author's identifier is hasAuthor.\n\nGiven the DBLP query for the author Gennady L. Andrienko:\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer WHERE { \n  ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/a/GennadyLAndrienko> \n}\n```\nWe need to translate this to an OpenAlex query. Since we are looking for papers authored by Gennady L. Andrienko, we need to find the author's identifier in OpenAlex first. From the ER2 mapping, we see that Gennady L. Andrienko's identifier in DBLP is https://dblp.org/pid/a/GennadyLAndrienko, and in OpenAlex it is https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8574-6295.\n\nSo, the corresponding OpenAlex query for finding the papers authored by Gennady L. Andrienko would be:\n```\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?work WHERE { \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . \n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . \n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8574-6295\" . \n}\n```\nHowever, we need to directly query the OpenAlex identifier, which is not directly available in the given DBLP query. Instead, we should directly query the OpenAlex query using the ORCID identifier of the author. But since the instruction asks to translate the DBLP query to OpenAlex, and we don't have a direct mapping for the query, we will assume the translation is based on the ER2 mapping.\n\nThe actual SPARQL query for the author in OpenAlex should directly use the ORCID identifier of the author. Therefore, the complete SPARQL query would be:\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?work WHERE { \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . \n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . \n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8574-6295\" . \n}\n</sparql>\n```\nPlease note that the translation might not be 100% accurate without more detailed information on the relationship between the two knowledge graphs."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) based on the information provided, we need to map the relation \"authoredBy\" from DBLP to the corresponding relation in OpenAlex, which is \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\". Also, we need to replace the entity identifier of W. Wu in DBLP with its corresponding ORCID ID in OpenAlex.\n\n\nGiven that in the ER2 mapping, the relation \"authoredBy\" in DBLP is mapped to \"hasAuthorship\" and \"hasAuthor\" in OpenAlex, and considering the provided context, we will use \"hasAuthorship\" in the SPARQL query for OpenAlex.\n\n\nHere's how you would translate the DBLP query into an OpenAlex query:\n\nThe DBLP query is:\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer WHERE { ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/92/382-5> }\n```\nFirst, we need to find the ORCID ID of W. Wu in the provided ER2 mapping:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"https://dblp.org/pid/92/382-5\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\",\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\nThe ORCID ID of W. Wu in OpenAlex is \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\".\n\nNow, we can write the OpenAlex SPARQL query:\n\n```\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\" .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, we need to notice that the OpenAlex query in Example 3 is a more direct match to what we're doing here. This query does not filter by author identity, so we can simplify our query to directly match the format used in Example 3:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\" .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query directly selects the publications (denoted by `?work` in OpenAlex ontology) that were authored by W. Wu, matching the question \"Which publications did W. Wu author?\""

We need to use both to find the authorship.\n- The relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>` is mapped to `<http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear>`. We need to use this to filter the publications by year.\n\nNow, let's construct the OpenAlex SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3275-2293\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 2)\n}\n```\n\nThe final SPARQL query within the tags is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3275-2293\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 2)\n}\n</sparql>"

Yautsiukhin` in DBLP is mapped to `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8493-1915` in OpenAlex.\n\nHowever, since we need to query based on the author's ORCiD, we will look for the ORCiD in the OpenAlex query. The given DBLP query is looking for papers authored by A. Yautsiukhin published in the last 6 years.\n\nSo, the corresponding OpenAlex query would be:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE { \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8493-1915\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 6)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query would return all works (papers) where the author has an ORCiD matching the specified one. Since we need the works authored by A. Yautsiukhin in the last 6 years, we can directly use the ORCiD in the OpenAlex query to filter the results.\n\nThe final, complete SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) is:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE { \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8493-1915\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 6)\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 based on the given information, we need to map the relations between DBLP and OpenAlex entities. The ER2 mapping indicates that the relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` in DBLP is equivalent to `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship>` and `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor>` in OpenAlex.\n\nGiven that we are looking for papers written by Mark van den Brand and Ramon R. H. Schiffelers together, we need to identify their OpenAlex IDs. The DBLP PID for Mark van den Brand is `https://dblp.org/pid/v/MarkvandenBrand`, and for Ramon R. H. Schiffelers, it is `https://dblp.org/pid/42/2894`. We can use the ER2 mapping to find their OpenAlex IDs.\n\nFor Mark van den Brand, the ER2 mapping gives us the OpenAlex ID `https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-6182`. However, for Ramon R. H. Schiffelers, the OpenAlex ID given by ER2 is `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969`, but the ID we are looking for is the entity associated with `https://dblp.org/pid/42/2894`. Given the ER2 mapping structure, we might need to directly map the DBLP PIDs to the correct OpenAlex IDs.\n\nHowever, since the question focuses on the equivalence of relations and not the direct mapping of PIDs, we'll proceed with the assumption that the OpenAlex ID for Ramon R. H. Schiffelers is indeed `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969` based on the provided ER2 mapping.\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query for KG2, OpenAlex:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-6182\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969\" .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, given the direct question, a more straightforward query would focus on the specific authored-by relation, assuming the entities are correctly mapped in the ER2. The query should directly ask for the works associated with both authors, assuming they co-authored papers. This might involve a slightly different approach, but given the information, the query aims to identify works (papers) where both authors are involved, which suggests an intersection or AND condition in the query logic. \n\nGiven the direct mapping and the explicit question, a more aligned query would indeed focus on the direct equivalence of the relations and the correct identification of the authors' OpenAlex IDs. However, the query structure provided aims to align with the examples given, focusing on the intersection of authors and works.\n\nTo refine the query based on the direct question and ensuring accuracy in the OpenAlex IDs, we should re-evaluate the ER2 mapping for a precise match of Ramon R. H. Schiffelers' OpenAlex ID. If the ID from the ER2 mapping directly does not match, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nGiven the aim for precision and the ER2 mapping structure, the final query should accurately reflect the direct mapping of entities and relations between DBLP and OpenAlex.\n\nUpon reviewing, the query needs to directly address the identified OpenAlex IDs for both authors accurately. If the ER2 mapping does not accurately reflect the OpenAlex ID for Ramon R. H. Schiffelers, the query would need adjustment.\n\nHere is the corrected and refined SPARQL query based on the direct mapping and the correct identification of authors' OpenAlex IDs:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-6182\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969\" .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query directly looks for works where both authors are involved, based on their correctly identified OpenAlex IDs."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) given the information above, we first need to identify the relevant entities and relationships in the entity and relation mapping (ER2). \n\nIn the ER2, we have the following mappings for the entities involved in the question:\n\n* DBLP: \"https://dblp.org/pid/45/3158-6\" (Wu, C.) and \"https://dblp.org/pid/x/ChunJasonXue\" (C. Jason Xue)\n* OpenAlex:\n\t+ \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-1413\" (mapped from Wu, C.)\n\t+ \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-9868\" (mapped from C. Jason Xue)\n\nThe relationship between these entities is that Wu, C. and C. Jason Xue authored the same papers together.\n\nThe relevant relationship in the ER2 for OpenAlex is:\n* \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\"\n\nWe can now construct the SPARQL query for OpenAlex:\n\n```\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE \n{\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-1413\" .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-9868\" .\n  \n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query will return papers written by Wu and C. Jason Xue separately, not together. To return papers written by both authors together, we need to modify the query to filter the results based on the intersection of the authors' ORCID IDs.\n\nSince the authors are the same person in the DBLP KG, we can use the same ORCID ID for both authors in the OpenAlex query. However, since the ORCID IDs are different in the ER2 (due to the mapping), we need to find a way to correctly map the authors in the OpenAlex query.\n\nOne possible solution is to use the intersection of the authors' ORCID IDs. To do this, we can use a FILTER clause to check if the ORCID IDs are the same for both authors.\n\nHere is the modified query:\n\n```\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE \n{\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-1413\" .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-9868\" .\n  \n  FILTER(?author1 = ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query will still not return the correct results because it will return papers written by the same author, not papers written by two different authors together.\n\nTo return papers written by two different authors together, we need to use a different approach. We can use the `oa:hasAuthorship` relationship to find the papers that have both authors as authors.\n\nHere is the modified query:\n\n```\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE \n{\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  \n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-1413\" .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-9868\" .\n  \n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query will still not return the correct results because it will return papers that have both authors as authors, but it will not guarantee that the papers are written together.\n\nTo return papers written by two different authors together, we need to use a different approach. We can use the `oa:hasAuthorship` relationship to find the papers that have both authors as authors, and then use a FILTER clause to check if the papers are written together.\n\nHowever, in this case, we do not have enough information to determine which papers were written together. The ER2 only provides the ORCID IDs of the authors, but it does not provide any information about the papers they wrote together.\n\nTherefore, we cannot provide a final, complete SPARQL query within the tags '<sparql>' and '</sparql>' based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, here is a modified version of the query that assumes that the papers written by Wu and C. Jason Xue together have the intersection of their ORCID IDs:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE \n{\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-1413\" .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-9868\" .\n  \n  FILTER(?author1 = ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will return papers that have the intersection of the ORCID IDs of Wu and C. Jason Xue, but it will not guarantee that the papers are written together.\n\nPlease note that this query is a modified version of the original query and it may not return the correct results. The correct query depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the structure of the data."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) based on the given information, we need to map the corresponding entities and relations from KG1 (DBLP) to KG2 (OpenAlex) using the Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2) provided.\n\nFrom the ER2 mapping, we can see that the relations in DBLP are mapped to OpenAlex as follows:\n- `authoredBy` in DBLP is mapped to `hasAuthorship` in OpenAlex.\n- `authoredBy` in DBLP is also mapped to `hasAuthor` in OpenAlex, but we're interested in the former for this query.\n\nThe DBLP query to find papers written by Carlos Cerrada and Pilar Merch\u00e1n together is:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer WHERE {\n  ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/28/4557> .\n  ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/01/2167> \n}\n```\n\nTo transform this into an OpenAlex query, we need to map `authoredBy` to `hasAuthorship` and find authors with the corresponding ORCID IDs. We also need to filter for the cases where the authors are not the same (to ensure the query finds papers written together).\n\nThe transformed OpenAlex query becomes:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further to avoid listing the authors twice and instead use the `FILTER` clause to check for the condition. We can achieve this by using a single `hasAuthorship` relation and filtering for the ORCID IDs:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n  FILTER(?author != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above query still has the same issue of listing authors twice. A more efficient way to write this is to use the `UNION` operator to combine two queries that filter for the two different authors separately:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n    ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n    ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n    ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n    ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n    FILTER(?author1 != ?author2) }\n  UNION\n  { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n    ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n    ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n    ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n    ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n    FILTER(?author1 != ?author2) }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above query is still not perfect because it lists the same work twice. To correct this and to make the query more efficient, we can use a single triple pattern with a filter clause to check for the condition:\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n  FILTER(?author != ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, the `FILTER` clause checks for the condition that the two authors are not equal, which is the opposite of what we want. To fix this, we can use a `NOT` operator in the `FILTER` clause:\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-6581\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-4829\" .\n  FILTER NOT(?author = ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will return the works written by Carlos Cerrada and Pilar Merch\u00e1n together."

Also, we need to adjust the `FILTER` to match the ORCID ID which is not used directly in the query but is used to filter the results.\n\nTo select co-authors, the query should be modified as follows:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?coauthor\nWHERE \n{\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?coauthor .\n  ?coauthor <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8433-159X\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8433-159X\" .\n  FILTER(?coauthor != ?author)\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query will return all co-authors of Antonio Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez."

Construct the SPARQL query using the OpenAlex relations.\n\nGiven the information from the ER2, the corresponding mapping for the given query is:\n\n{\n  \"DBLP\": \"https://dblp.org/pid/04/3218\",\n  \"OpenAlex\": [\n    \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8229-0512\"\n  ]\n}\n\n{\n  \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\",\n  \"OpenAlex\": [\n    \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\",\n    \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\"\n  ]\n}\n\n{\n  \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>\",\n  \"OpenAlex\": [\n    \"http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear\"\n  ]\n}\n\nSo we can map the following:\n\n* `authoredBy` in DBLP to `hasAuthorship` and `hasAuthor` in OpenAlex\n* `yearOfPublication` in DBLP to `hasPublicationYear` in OpenAlex\n\nNow, we can construct the SPARQL query using the OpenAlex relations:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work ?year\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8229-0512\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this is not the final complete SPARQL query as it does not specify the distinct `?firstanswer ?secondanswer` variables from the original DBLP query. To get the final query, we need to add the distinct variables to the query.\n\nHere is the final complete SPARQL query:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?firstanswer ?secondanswer\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8229-0512\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?secondanswer .\n  BIND(?work AS ?firstanswer)\n}\n</sparql>"

The information given in the context specifies the DBLP PID for Srinivas Katkoori as \"https://dblp.org/pid/01/4012\".\n\nGiven this information, the SPARQL query for KG2 can be constructed as follows:\n\n`PREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>`\n`PREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>`\n\n`SELECT DISTINCT ?work ?year`\n`WHERE { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .`\n`?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .`\n`?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7589-5836\" .`\n`?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .`\n\nHowever, this query does not filter for the author of the publication.

The DBLP query uses a single variable `?x` to represent the publication, and the query uses two variables `?work` and `?location` to represent the publication and venue respectively.\n\nTo correctly map the DBLP query to the OpenAlex schema, we need to use a single variable to represent the publication and use the same variable to represent the venue and title.\n\nHere is the corrected SPARQL query:\n <sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication ?title WHERE { \n  ?publication oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . \n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . \n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4042-9739\" . \n  ?publication oa:hasLocation ?location . \n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue . \n  ?publication dct:title ?title . \n  FILTER(BIND(SAME_AS(?publication, ?location, ?venue), true))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query uses a single variable `?publication` to represent the publication, and it uses the same variable to represent the venue and title.\n\nHowever, the above query still doesn't filter the results exactly like the original DBLP query. The original DBLP query uses two patterns to match the publication: `?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> ?author` and `?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn> ?venue`. \n\nTo filter the results exactly like the original DBLP query, we need to use two separate patterns to match the authorship and publication.\n\nHere is the corrected SPARQL query:\n <sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication ?title WHERE { \n  ?publication oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . \n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . \n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4042-9739\" . \n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author . \n  ?publication oa:hasLocation ?location . \n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue . \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 . \n  ?work dct:title ?title . \n  FILTER(BIND(SAME_AS(?publication, ?location), true) && BIND(SAME_AS(?authorship, ?authorship2), true))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query uses two separate patterns to match the authorship and publication, and it filters the results exactly like the original DBLP query. \n\nI hope this corrected query meets your requirements!"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce the SPARQL query for KG2, we need to map the DBLP query to the corresponding OpenAlex query using the ER2 mapping.\n\nGiven the DBLP query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?firstanswer ?secondanswer WHERE { \n  ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/95/9002> . \n  ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication> ?y . \n  FILTER(?y > YEAR(NOW())-9) . \n  ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn> ?firstanswer . \n  ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#title> ?secondanswer \n}\n```\nWe can map it to the OpenAlex query using the ER2 mapping as follows:\n\n* `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy` is mapped to `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor`\n* `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication` is mapped to `http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear`\n* `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn` is mapped to `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource`\n* `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#title` is mapped to `http://purl.org/dc/terms/title`\n\nSo, the OpenAlex query would be:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"0000-0003-4200-2584\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 9) .\n  ?work oa:hasLocation ?location .\n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .\n  ?work dct:title ?title .\n}\n```\nHowever, to find the titles of the papers, we need to join the `oa:hasAuthorship` relation with the `oa:hasSource` relation. We can do this by adding another join condition:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"0000-0003-4200-2584\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 9) .\n  ?work oa:hasLocation ?location .\n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .\n  ?work oa:hasSource ?source .\n  ?source oa:hasTitle ?title .\n}\n```\nBut this will not work, because we don't have a direct mapping for the `oa:hasSource` relation in the ER2 mapping. We need to use the `oa:hasLocation` relation to get the venue.\n\nSo, the final OpenAlex query would be:\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4200-2584\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 9) .\n  ?work oa:hasLocation ?location .\n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .\n  ?work oa:hasTitle ?title .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nThis query will return the titles of the papers written by Gerardo Di Martino in the last 9 years, along with the venues where they were published."

We can do this by adding a triple pattern to the query:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5164-7910\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 3) .\n  ?work oa:hasLocation ?location .\n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .\n  ?work dct:title ?title .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query will return the venues where S. K. Houghten published papers and the titles of these papers in the last 3 years.\n\nNote: Since the ORCID ID of S. K. Houghten is not available in the ER2 mapping, we need to use the one provided in the question."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To generate the SPARQL query for KG2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the corresponding DBLP query for the given question.\n2. Map the DBLP query to the corresponding OpenAlex query using the ER2 mapping.\n\nGiven the question \"In which venues did Lasota, Slawomir publish papers and what are the titles of these papers?\", we can see that the corresponding DBLP query is:\n\nDBLP: SELECT DISTINCT ?firstanswer ?secondanswer WHERE { ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/97/3803> . ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication> ?y . FILTER(?y > YEAR(NOW())-7) . ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn> ?firstanswer . ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#title> ?secondanswer }\n\nNow, we can map this query to the corresponding OpenAlex query using the ER2 mapping.\n\nHere's the mapping:\n\n- `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` maps to `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship>` and `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor>`\n- `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>` maps to `http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear`\n- `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn>` maps to `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation>` and `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource>`\n- `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#title>` maps to `http://purl.org/dc/terms/title`\n\nUsing these mappings, we can generate the OpenAlex query:\n\nOpenAlex: PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> PREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> PREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>  SELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . ?author oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 . ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor <https://dblp.org/pid/97/3803> .  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 7) .  ?work oa:hasLocation ?location . ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .  ?work dct:title ?title . } \n\nHowever, this query is not entirely correct. We need to filter the results to only include the works that have both a location (venue) and a title. We can do this by using a subquery to filter the works and then joining the filtered works with the locations and titles.\n\nHere's the corrected OpenAlex query:\n\nOpenAlex: PREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> PREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> PREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>  SELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . ?author oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 . ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor <https://dblp.org/pid/97/3803> .  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 7) .  ?filteredWork FILTER(?filteredWork oa:hasLocation ?location) . ?filteredWork oa:hasLocation ?location . ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .  ?filteredWork dct:title ?title . } \n\nHowever, we need to correct the last part of the query, as we are trying to filter the work based on the existence of a location, we should use a subquery to filter the works and then join the filtered works with the locations and titles. Here's the corrected OpenAlex query:\n\nOpenAlex: PREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> PREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>  SELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title WHERE { ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . ?author oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 . ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor <https://dblp.org/pid/97/3803> .  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 7) .  ?work FILTER(?work oa:hasLocation ?location) . ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .  ?work dct:title ?title . } \n\nNow, let's put everything together in a single query:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/> \nPREFIX dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?venue ?title\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor <https://dblp.org/pid/97/3803> .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  FILTER(?year > YEAR(NOW()) - 7) .\n  ?work FILTER(?work oa:hasLocation ?location) .\n  ?location oa:hasSource ?venue .\n  ?work dct:title ?title .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query will retrieve the venues and titles of the papers published by Lasota, Slawomir in the last 7 years."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) from the given information, we need to map the relations and entities from KG1 (DBLP) to their corresponding representations in KG2 (OpenAlex). \n\nThe question asks if Quaresma, P. and Vanda S. co-authored a paper. From the DBLP query, we can see that the query checks if a paper is authored by both <https://dblp.org/pid/71/4599> (Quaresma, P.) and <https://dblp.org/pid/77/783> (Vanda S.).\n\nBased on the ER2 mapping provided, we see that:\n- The DBLP PID <https://dblp.org/pid/71/4599> is mapped to OpenAlex ORCID https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-4935.\n- The DBLP PID <https://dblp.org/pid/77/783> is mapped to OpenAlex ORCID https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3953-6123.\n- The DBLP relation for authoredBy is mapped to the OpenAlex relation hasAuthorship, which is further mapped to hasAuthor.\n\nHowever, the direct mapping does not directly tell us how to query for co-authorship in OpenAlex. We need to infer this from the given examples and the structure of OpenAlex's ontology (e.g., hasAuthorship, hasAuthor). \n\nTo query for papers co-authored by two specific authors in OpenAlex, we would query for works (papers) where both authors are associated with the same work through hasAuthorship relations. Here's how we might formulate the query based on the provided mapping and the structure of OpenAlex's ontology:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-4935\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3953-6123\" .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query directly translates the DBLP query to OpenAlex without considering the actual query asked (if Quaresma, P. and Vanda S. co-authored a paper). We actually need to check if there's at least one work where both authors are authors, not necessarily the same work. \n\nHere's a corrected query that reflects the actual task:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-4935\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3953-6123\" .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n\nThis query checks for the existence of a work co-authored by both Quaresma, P. and Vanda S. If any work is found, it means they co-authored at least one paper.\n\nHowever, considering the actual task at hand (to check if Quaresma, P. and Vanda S. co-authored a paper), the query should simply be checking if they both are associated with the same work through hasAuthorship relations, without necessarily filtering out non-matching authors:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-4935\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3953-6123\" .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query checks if there exists at least one work that both Quaresma, P. and Vanda S. are co-authors of, which is the actual question being asked."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 based on the given information, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the entity and relation mapping between KG1 (DBLP) and KG2 (OpenAlex).\n2. Determine the specific relation and entity in DBLP that corresponds to the question.\n3. Translate the DBLP query into a query for OpenAlex using the entity and relation mapping.\n\nFrom the entity and relation mapping (ER2), we can see that:\n\n- Luigi Chisci's DBLP identifier is <https://dblp.org/pid/68/5289>, and his OpenAlex ORCID is https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577.\n- N. Forti's DBLP identifier is <https://dblp.org/pid/152/4133>, and his OpenAlex ORCID is https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616.\n- The relation \"authoredBy\" in DBLP corresponds to \"hasAuthorship\" and \"hasAuthor\" in OpenAlex.\n\nGiven the question \"Was a paper not not co-authored by Luigi Chisci and N. Forti?\", we need to find all papers that do not have both Luigi Chisci and N. Forti as authors.\n\nThe corresponding DBLP query is:\n```sparql\nASK { ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/68/5289> . ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/152/4133> }\n```\n\nNow, let's translate this query into a query for OpenAlex:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\" .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship3 .\n    ?authorship3 oa:hasAuthor ?author3 .\n    ?author3 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\" .\n  }\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship4 .\n    ?authorship4 oa:hasAuthor ?author4 .\n    ?author4 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\" .\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nHowever, this query has a logical error. To correct it, we should instead use a single `FILTER NOT EXISTS` clause to check if both authors exist for a given work, rather than checking individually. Here's the corrected query:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  FILTER(?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\")\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  FILTER(?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\")\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship3 .\n    ?authorship3 oa:hasAuthor ?author3 .\n    FILTER((?author3 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\" && ?author3 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\"))\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nOr, more concisely, using a existential quantification:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  FILTER(?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\")\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  FILTER(?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\")\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship3 .\n    ?authorship3 oa:hasAuthor ?author3 .\n    ?author3 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577\" .\n    ?author3 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616\" .\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

DBLP PID 44/5109 is mapped to ORCID ID 0000-0003-2294-3774 in OpenAlex.\n\nThe third mapping is not relevant to this query, as it maps the DBLP authoredBy property to OpenAlex hasAuthorship and hasAuthor properties.\n\nNow, let's construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex):\n```\n<prefixes>\n  PREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n  PREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n</prefixes>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6180-7033\" .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-3774\" .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\n**Final SPARQL query:**\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?work\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6180-7033\" .\n  \n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  ?author2 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-3774\" .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>"

According to the ER2 mapping, we have:\n\n* `DBLP:<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` maps to `OpenAlex:https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship`\n* `DBLP:<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>` maps to `OpenAlex:http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear`\n\nWe also need to find the corresponding OpenAlex ORCID ID for P.

We need to count the number of publications for each year and then calculate the average.\n\nHere's the corrected query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer)\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5798-1426\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  BIND(COUNT(?year) AS ?count)\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n```\nHowever, this query will not work as expected because we are grouping by `?year` and not by `?count`. We need to modify the query to count the number of publications for each year and then calculate the average.\n\nHere's the final corrected query:\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer)\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5798-1426\" .\n  ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  BIND(COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?count)\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nThis query will give us the average number of publications per year for P.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) given the instruction and examples, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the corresponding entity and relation mapping (ER2) for the given DBLP query.\n2. Map the DBLP query to the corresponding OpenAlex query based on the ER2.\n\nThe given DBLP query is:\n```sql\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer) { \n  SELECT (COUNT(?y) AS ?count) \n  WHERE { \n    ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/09/9051> . \n    ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication> ?y \n  } \n  GROUP BY ?y \n}\n```\nThe ER2 for KG1 (DBLP) and KG2 (OpenAlex) is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"https://dblp.org/pid/09/9051\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\",\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\nBased on the ER2, we can identify the corresponding mapping for the given DBLP query:\n\n* `?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/09/9051>` maps to `?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship . ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author . ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\" .`\n* `?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication> ?y` maps to `?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .`\n\nNow, we can construct the OpenAlex query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer) {\n  SELECT (COUNT(?year) AS ?count)\n  WHERE {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n    ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\" .\n    ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n```\nHowever, this query will not return the average number of research papers published per year. To fix this, we need to group the results by year and count the number of papers published in each year, then calculate the average.\n\nHere's the corrected query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer) {\n  SELECT (COUNT(?work) AS ?count)\n  WHERE {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n    ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\" .\n    ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n    FILTER (?year >= 2000 && ?year <= 2022)  # assuming the author has published papers in this range\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n```\nThis query will return the average number of research papers published by the author per year.\n\nHowever, the ER2 mapping is not perfect, and we need to adjust the query to match the correct mapping. The correct ER2 mapping for the given DBLP query is:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"https://dblp.org/pid/09/9051\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#yearOfPublication>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"http://purl.org/spar/fabio/hasPublicationYear\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\nWith this corrected ER2 mapping, the OpenAlex query becomes:\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer) {\n  SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?count)\n  WHERE {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n    ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\" .\n    ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n```\nThis query will return the average number of research papers published by the author per year.\n\nHere is the final, complete SPARQL query within the tags '<sparql>' and '</sparql>':\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX fabio: <http://purl.org/spar/fabio/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer) {\n  SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?count)\n  WHERE {\n    ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n    ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-7058\" .\n    ?work fabio:hasPublicationYear ?year .\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?year\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

In DBLP, this would be achieved by finding all `?answer` that `?x` (a paper) is co-authored by, given that `?x` is authored by Stefano B. (`<https://dblp.org/pid/63/3800>`). In OpenAlex, the query will find all `?author` that co-authored papers with the author identified by `https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886`.\n\nHere's how we construct the query for OpenAlex, assuming the appropriate prefixes have been declared (e.g., `oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>` for OpenAlex ontology prefixes):\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?author) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?co_authorship .\n  ?co_authorship oa:hasAuthor ?co_author .\n  ?co_author != ?author .\n  FILTER(?co_author != <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886>)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above query might not directly match the mapping and the original intention. Let's refine it to ensure it accurately reflects the information given:\n\nWe need to find all `?co_author` that co-authored with `https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886` and exclude `https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886` itself.\n\nSo, the corrected query should be:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?co_author) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0492-0886\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?co_authorship .\n  ?co_authorship oa:hasAuthor ?co_author .\n  FILTER(?author != ?co_author)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will count all distinct authors who co-authored papers with Stefano B., excluding Stefano B. himself."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex), we need to map the DBLP query to the OpenAlex query based on the ER2 mapping.\n\nThe original DBLP query is:\n```sparql}\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?answer) AS ?count) WHERE { ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/70/310> . ?x <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> ?answer FILTER(?answer != <https://dblp.org/pid/70/310>) }\n```\nThe ER2 mapping shows that:\n\n* DBLP `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` is mapped to OpenAlex `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor`\n* DBLP `<https://dblp.org/pid/70/310>` is mapped to OpenAlex `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-3733`\n\nTherefore, the OpenAlex query should be:\n```sparql}\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?author) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  FILTER(?author != \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-3733\")\n}\n```\nHowever, this query will count all authors of works, not just co-authors. To get the co-authors, we need to filter the results to exclude the author of interest.\n\nThe original DBLP query is designed to count the number of distinct co-authors, so we need to modify the OpenAlex query to achieve the same result. We can do this by adding a filter to exclude the author of interest.\n\nThe modified OpenAlex query is:\n```sparql}\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?author) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-3733\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n```\nThis query will count the number of distinct co-authors of works authored by the person with ORCID `https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-3733`.\n\nThe final, complete SPARQL query is:\n```sparql}\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?author) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship1 .\n  ?authorship1 oa:hasAuthor ?author1 .\n  ?author1 <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-3733\" .\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship2 .\n  ?authorship2 oa:hasAuthor ?author2 .\n  FILTER(?author1 != ?author2)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nNote that I've used the `https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId` property to map the ORCID ID to the OpenAlex ontology, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the ER2 mapping. If there's a different mapping, please let me know and I'll update the query accordingly."

Let's analyze the given DBLP query and the ER2 mapping between DBLP and OpenAlex.\n\n\nGiven DBLP query:\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?answer) AS ?count) WHERE { ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> <https://dblp.org/pid/20/5348> }\n```\n\nER2 mapping:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"https://dblp.org/pid/20/5348\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-6226\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"DBLP\": \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\",\n    \"OpenAlex\": [\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\",\n      \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBased on the ER2 mapping, we can see that the relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` in DBLP is mapped to multiple relations in OpenAlex: `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor`. Since we want to retrieve the number of papers authored by Cerquitelli, T., we should use the relation that directly corresponds to authorship, which is `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship`.\n\n\nNow, let's construct the OpenAlex query using the corresponding relation:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-6226> .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query will only return the papers that directly match the ORCID ID provided in the ER2 mapping. We need to modify the query to use the relation that corresponds to the original query in DBLP, which is `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy`.\n\nSince the query is asking for the number of papers authored by Cerquitelli, T., we can use the ORCID ID directly in the query as it is the unique identifier for the author. \n\nHowever, based on the provided ER2 mapping, we see that the ORCID ID in DBLP is not directly available, but we can use the provided ORCID ID for the author in OpenAlex to get the papers authored by Cerquitelli, T.\n\nTherefore, the final OpenAlex query is:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?work oa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship oa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-6226> .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will return the number of papers authored by Cerquitelli, T. in the OpenAlex knowledge graph."
