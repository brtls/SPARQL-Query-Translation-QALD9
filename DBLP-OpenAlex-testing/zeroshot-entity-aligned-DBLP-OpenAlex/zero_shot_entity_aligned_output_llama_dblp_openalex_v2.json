        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) based on the given information, we'll follow the entity and relation mapping (ER2) provided to map the relations and entities from DBLP to OpenAlex. The main focus is to find the papers authored by Gennady L. Andrienko.\n\nGiven the ER2 mapping:\n\n1. Gennady L. Andrienko is mapped to an ORCID ID which is \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8574-6295\" in OpenAlex.\n2. The relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` is mapped to two different relations in OpenAlex: `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor`.\n\nSince we're looking to find the papers authored by Gennady L. Andrienko, and we have the ORCID ID, we can query OpenAlex directly using the ORCID ID to get the `hasAuthorship` relation, which in turn will give us the authorship details including the papers.\n\nThe SPARQL query to achieve this would be:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n    PREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\n    PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT ?paper\n    WHERE {\n        orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295 a semoa:Author.\n        ?authorship a semoa:hasAuthorship.\n        ?authorship semoa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295.\n        ?paper semoa:hasAuthorship ?authorship.\n    }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, the above SPARQL query is not directly answering which papers were written but rather which authorships were attributed to the author. To correct this and directly answer the question of which papers the author wrote, we would need to adjust the query to directly relate `orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295` with the papers it has authored through the `hasAuthor` relation. This would typically involve a more complex query that directly links papers to the author through the `hasAuthor` relation in OpenAlex, which might look like this:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n    PREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\n    PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT ?paper\n    WHERE {\n        orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295 a semoa:Author.\n        ?paper a semoa:Paper.\n        ?paper semoa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295.\n    }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query, however, simplifies the problem by assuming a direct linkage between papers and authors without considering the intermediate `hasAuthorship` relationship. For a more accurate query that reflects the original mapping provided, we would need to incorporate the intermediate step correctly, which might involve additional queries or a more complex join in the SPARQL query. \n\nFor the sake of providing a complete SPARQL query based on the original instruction and focusing on the direct authorship relation in OpenAlex:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n    PREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\n    PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT ?paper\n    WHERE {\n        orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295 a semoa:Author.\n        ?paper a semoa:Paper.\n        ?paper semoa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-8574-6295.\n    }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nPlease note, this query does not incorporate the `hasAuthorship` relation as suggested in the ER2 mapping for a more complex query that accurately reflects the original mapping."

The task is to find the publications authored by Maia Rohm, which is represented by the entity \"https://dblp.org/pid/222/1191\" in DBLP. We need to find the ORCID of this author and then use it to query the OpenAlex KG.\n\nFirst, we find the ORCID of Maia Rohm in DBLP using the SPARQL query:\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ?orcid WHERE { ?answer <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#author> <https://dblp.org/pid/222/1191> . FILTER regex(str(?answer), \"Maia Rohm\") }\n```\nThis query finds the publications authored by Maia Rohm in DBLP. Note that this query is not needed as we have the direct mapping to the ORCID in the ER2. However, I included it for clarity.\n\nNow, we use the ER2 mapping to find the ORCID of Maia Rohm in OpenAlex:\n```\nSELECT ?orcid WHERE { <https://dblp.org/pid/222/1191> <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> ?answer . ?answer a <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/Author> ; <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?authorship . ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author ; <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> ?orcid }\n```\nHowever, we need to correct the query to only match the ORCID of Maia Rohm. The correct query should be:\n```\nSELECT ?orcid WHERE { ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author ; <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> ?orcid . FILTER regex(str(?author), \"Maia Rohm\") }\n```\nWait, we don't have the author's name in the ER2. We have the DBLP PID, which is used to find the ORCID. Let's correct the approach.\n\nWe use the ER2 to find the ORCID of Maia Rohm in OpenAlex using the DBLP PID:\n```\nSELECT ?orcid WHERE { <https://dblp.org/pid/222/1191> <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy> ?answer . ?answer a <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/Author> ; <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> ?orcid }\n```\nNow that we have the ORCID of Maia Rohm, we can use it to find the publications she authored in OpenAlex. We use the ER2 to find the correct properties and URIs:\n```\nSELECT ?publication WHERE { <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5108-6874> <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?authorship . ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author ; <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasPublication> ?publication }\n```\nHowever, we need to match the authorship of Maia Rohm. We can use the ORCID to filter the results. Here's the complete SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex), within the tags '<sparql>' and '</sparql>':\n```\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5108-6874> .\n  ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasPublication> ?publication\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nHowever, the question asks for the publications authored by Maia Rohm, which means we should be looking for the publications that are the object of the <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasPublication> property, and that are connected to the authorship that has Maia Rohm as its subject.\n\nHere's the corrected final SPARQL query within the tags '<sparql>' and '</sparql>':\n```\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5108-6874> <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?authorship .\n  ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author .\n  ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5108-6874> .\n  ?authorship <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasPublication> ?publication\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

To do this, we use the ER2 mapping to link the DBLP PID \"https://dblp.org/pid/170/4064\" to the ORCID ID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-0913\".\n\n2. **Predicate (relation)**: The relation we are interested in is \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\" in OpenAlex, which corresponds to the \"authoredBy\" relation in DBLP.\n\n3. **Object (publications)**: We are looking for publications authored by \"Wiebe Van Ranst\".\n\nGiven the above steps and the logic for the author, we can construct the SPARQL query for KG2 as follows:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?author { <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-0913> }\n  ?authorship a <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/Authorship> ;\n              :hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?publication a <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/Publication> ;\n               :hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, this does not exactly match the instructions because we need to incorporate the \"authoredBy\" relation equivalent in OpenAlex into the query. The corrected query should directly link the author to the publications without using a generic \"hasAuthorship\" relation. Since the ER2 mapping provides the exact equivalents for DBLP's \"authoredBy\" in OpenAlex as \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\", we would actually be looking for publications that have the authorship by Wiebe Van Ranst, but the direct equivalent relation is not explicitly listed in the ER2 mapping for OpenAlex. The closest match to achieve the desired result based on the given information would involve using the \"hasAuthor\" relation as a proxy for \"authoredBy\". Therefore, the query should be modified as follows to correctly implement the author logic as specified:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?author { <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-0913> }\n  ?publication :hasAuthor ?author .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query directly selects publications that have the author \"Wiebe Van Ranst\" based on their ORCID ID, which is the closest implementation of the provided logic given the available mappings."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex), we need to follow the instructions and the given ER2 mapping. The main goal is to find publications authored by W. Wu. We know that in DBLP, the relation between an author and their authored works is represented by `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>`. We also know the mapping of this relation to OpenAlex, which includes `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor`. \n\nMoreover, the ORCID of W. Wu in OpenAlex is `https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589`. We will use this to identify the author.\n\nHere's the breakdown of how we will construct the SPARQL query:\n\n1. We will use the ORCID to find the author in OpenAlex.\n2. We will then use the hasAuthorship relation to get the publications that the author has authored.\n3. Finally, we will use the hasAuthor relation to get the author from the hasAuthorship relation.\n\nGiven these steps, here is how we can construct the SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX soa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?publication\nWHERE\n{\n  ?author dbo:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\" .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author dbo:orcidId ?authorOrCID .\n  ?publication ?relation ?authorship .\n  FILTER(?relation IN (soa:hasAuthorship, soa:hasAuthor) && ?authorship ?soa:hasAuthor ?author )\n  FILTER(?author = ?authorOrCID)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query still needs refinement. The original question asks for what W. Wu authored, so we need to replace `?publication` with the actual publication and use the relation to get the publication's details.\n\nHere's how we would construct that:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX soa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?publication\nWHERE\n{\n  ?author dbo:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\" .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author dbo:orcidId ?authorOrCID .\n  ?publication soa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  FILTER(?author = ?authorOrCID)\n}\n```\n\nThis will give us all the publications authored by W. Wu.\n\nHowever, we are still missing one crucial piece of information. We need to filter by the author's name, which is W. Wu. Unfortunately, we are missing the mapping of the author's name to the ORCID in the ER2 mapping provided.\n\nIf we had the mapping, we could add another filter to the query to match the author's name with W. Wu.\n\nSince we don't have that information, let's assume that the ORCID `https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589` is unique to W. Wu, and we can proceed with the query as is.\n\nHere is the final query within the required tags:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX soa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?publication\nWHERE\n{\n  ?author dbo:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\" .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  ?authorship soa:hasAuthor ?author .\n  ?author dbo:orcidId ?authorOrCID .\n  ?publication soa:hasAuthorship ?authorship .\n  FILTER(?author = ?authorOrCID)\n}\n</sparql>"
