The goal is to find papers written by a person associated with the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3166-1517\".\n\nFirst, we identify the mappings:\n- The person's ID in DBLP is \"https://dblp.org/pid/68/1945\".\n- The relation for papers written by in OpenAlex can be found by looking up the equivalent relation in the ER2 mapping for the relation \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\" in DBLP, which is \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\".\n\nHere's how we can construct the SPARQL query for OpenAlex:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  SELECT ?answer\n  WHERE {\n    ?answer ?relation ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3166-1517\" .\n    ?author ?authoredBy ?answer .\n    ?authoredBy a ?relation .\n    FILTER(?relation = <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> || ?relation = <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor>)\n  }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, this query isn't complete. It seems we need to add a condition to link the `?author` with its `?authoredBy`. Given that the `?authoredBy` relation is supposed to lead to papers written by the author, the correct query should actually look for authors that have a `?authoredBy` relation leading to `?answer`.\n\nGiven the corrected understanding of the task, the complete and corrected SPARQL query would be to find all `?answer` where `?author` (identified by ORCID) has a `?authoredBy` relation to `?answer`. However, since the question actually asks for papers written by the author, we need to use the correct relationship defined in the ER2 mapping.\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  SELECT ?answer\n  WHERE {\n    ?answer ?relation ?author .\n    ?author <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3166-1517\" .\n    ?author <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?answer .\n    FILTER(?relation = <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> || ?relation = <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor>)\n  }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nIn this query, we are directly looking for `?answer`s that are related to `?author` through the `hasAuthorship` or `hasAuthor` relationship in OpenAlex, directly linking the ORCID to the authored works."

In OpenAlex, the author is identified by the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\".\n\nGiven this information, the SPARQL query for KG2 would look for publications where the author is identified by the specified ORCID.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589> .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the ER2 mapping indicates that the exact relation to use in OpenAlex for authoredBy might be either \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\" or \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\". Without further information to specify which one is the correct mapping, we might need to use both to ensure we capture all relevant publications.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589> .\n  UNION\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589> .\n}\n```\n\nThis query looks for publications in OpenAlex where the author is identified by the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589\", using both \"hasAuthorship\" and \"hasAuthor\" relations.\n\nIf we substitute the ORCID for the author with the one from the ER2 mapping, the query would be:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589> .\n  UNION\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-0589> .\n}\n```\n\nBut since we're asked to use the ORCID \"https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId\", we will replace the ORCID in the query with this one for consistency:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?publication\nWHERE {\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> .\n  UNION\n  ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, it seems there was an oversight in the original query. To accurately complete the task as requested, let's ensure we're focusing on the correct relation for the author. The actual query for finding publications authored by W. Wu, given the new ORCID and considering the mappings, should directly use the correct relation and URI for the author in OpenAlex. This would mean directly linking the \"hasAuthor\" or \"hasAuthorship\" relation to the actual ORCID ID provided by DBpedia (which would match the one in the ER2 mapping), not a general ORCID ID.\n\nGiven the context, and the provided instructions, the query then simplifies into:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer WHERE {\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query uses the \"hasAuthor\" relation in OpenAlex and links it to the ORCID ID from DBpedia, which is assumed to be the correct mapping for the author W. Wu in the context of the question."

Specifically, we are interested in mapping the DBLP relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn>` to the OpenAlex relation(s).\n\nGiven that we need to find conferences or journals where Andrew Luxton-Reilly published papers, we are looking to find the OpenAlex relation that corresponds to the publication venue. According to the ER2 mapping, the DBLP relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn>` maps to the OpenAlex relation `<https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource>`.\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use the ORCID for the author instead of the DBLP author ID, and considering the ER2 mapping does not directly provide a mapping from the author's DBLP ID to the ORCID, we need to first find the author's ORCID. Since we are given the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8269-2909\" for Andrew Luxton-Reilly in the ER2 mapping, we can directly use this in our query without needing to map the DBLP author ID to the ORCID.\n\nHere is the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) that finds the conferences or journals where Andrew Luxton-Reilly published papers:\n\n<sparql>\n  SELECT DISTINCT ?answer\n  WHERE {\n    ?author a <https://schema.org/Person> ;\n            <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId> \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8269-2909\" .\n    ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author .\n    ?publication <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource> ?answer .\n  }\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, notice that the query above assumes that the author is directly linked to publications in OpenAlex, which might not be the case if the author's publications are not directly in the OpenAlex dataset. To accurately reflect the original instruction to find conferences or journals where Andrew Luxton-Reilly published papers, we should specifically target the publication venues for the author's works in OpenAlex. But, since we don't have a direct mapping from the author's works to their ORCID in the original ER2 mapping, and the ORCID is provided directly, the query above assumes that the author's publications are already in OpenAlex and directly linked to their ORCID. \n\nFor a more accurate reflection of the original instruction assuming the ORCID is used to find publications, we should look into the actual publications authored by the author with the given ORCID, but this is not directly supported by the given ER2 mapping. Therefore, the query above is a simplified version that directly looks for publications by the author using their ORCID, without considering the original DBLP publications as input.\n\nTo refine this, if we had a direct mapping from DBLP author IDs to OpenAlex entities or if we were provided with a way to link the author's DBLP publications to their OpenAlex ORCID directly, we could create a more targeted query that specifically looks for conferences or journals where Andrew Luxton-Reilly published papers, based on his DBLP publications. However, with the given information and mappings, the query above is the best approximation to find publications by the author."

Given that we are working with a different KG and need to map the queries, we'll adjust the query to use the corresponding properties and IDs.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex):\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties in OpenAlex for the `publishedIn` relation of KG1. From ER2, we see that `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn>` in DBLP is mapped to `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource` in OpenAlex. We will use both of these for our query.\n\n2. Identify the ID for Alabbas, M. in OpenAlex. The provided ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-5075\" is mentioned in ER2 as the mapping for `https://dblp.org/pid/97/10489` in DBLP. However, to directly use the ORCID in our OpenAlex query, we need to map it correctly.\n\n3. Construct the SPARQL query based on the above steps.\n\nHowever, given the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-5075\" as the target ID in OpenAlex, and the fact that we are directly mapping from the KG1 context to KG2, we'll directly use the ORCID in our query. \n\nHere's the final, complete SPARQL query:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer \nWHERE {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-5075> .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource> ?answer .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation> ?answer .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query seeks all `?answer` where it is directly linked to an author with the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-5075\" through `hasAuthor`, and also satisfies the conditions of being a `hasSource` or a `hasLocation` for that publication."

However, this would result in a query that is not efficient.\n\nA more efficient way to do this is to use the `SERVICE` keyword to query the KG2 twice, once for each ORCID, and then use the `FILTER` keyword to filter the results to only include papers that have both ORCIDs as authors.\n\nUnfortunately, the `SERVICE` keyword cannot be used with `FILTER` in SPARQL. So, we will have to use the `OPTIONAL` keyword instead.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer\nWHERE { \n  ?author1 <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-6182> .\n  ?author2 <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969> .\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?author1 .\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> ?author2 .\n  OPTIONAL { ?author1 <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author2 } .\n  OPTIONAL { ?author2 <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> ?author1 } .\n}\n```\n\nThis query will return all papers that have both ORCIDs as authors.\n\nHowever, this query will return papers that have one author as author and the other author as co-author. If you only want papers that have both authors as authors, you can use the following query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer\nWHERE { \n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3529-6182> .\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3297-2969> .\n}\n```\n\nThis query will return all papers that have both ORCIDs as authors.\n\nHowever, the question asks for papers written by Mark van den Brand and Ramon R. H. Schiffelers together, so we need to use a more complex query that queries the KG2 for papers that have both ORCIDs as authors.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the `OPTIONAL` keyword in SPARQL to query for papers that have either ORCID, and then use the `BIND` keyword to create a variable that is true if both ORCIDs are present.

The relation \"<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>\" in DBLP corresponds to \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\" and \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\" in OpenAlex.\n\nGiven that we need to find papers written by Aykut Beke and Kumbasar, T. together, we are essentially looking for articles where both of their ORCID IDs are linked as authors.

But to simplify and focus on publications where both authors are present, we can structure the query as follows:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> <http://example.org/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer \nWHERE {\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4620-8061> .\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9366-0240> .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, considering the requirement to find collaboratively written papers and acknowledging the potential for missing author information, a more robust approach would involve using `FILTER` to ensure that both authors are present in the results. But since we are tasked with finding papers where both authors are explicitly mentioned, the above query will suffice for this specific task.\n\nFor clarity and adherence to the format requested, here's the query within the specified tags:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/> <http://example.org/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer \nWHERE {\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4620-8061> .\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9366-0240> .\n}\n</sparql>"

Identify the subject (Vladimir B., which is <https://dblp.org/pid/83/460> in DBLP) in the ER2 mapping for OpenAlex.\n2. Determine the predicate (the relation that connects authors) in the ER2 mapping for OpenAlex, which includes \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship\" and \"https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor\".\n3. The object of the query is the ORCID of the co-authors, which we'll reference using the predicate \"https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId\".\n\nHere's the SPARQL query:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX semo: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer\nWHERE {\n  ?x semo:hasAuthorship ?answer .\n  ?x dbo:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\" .\n  FILTER(?answer != \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\")\n}\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, since the ER2 mapping provided earlier does not directly map the DBLP PID to an ORCID in OpenAlex, but rather maps it to an OpenAlex identifier which we don't have, the above query might not directly apply as it's based on the assumption of direct mapping of ORCIDs.\n\nTo accurately construct the query, you'd need to know the OpenAlex identifier that corresponds to Vladimir B. (assuming it's \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\" which was used in the explanation for illustration, not directly inferred from the given ER2 mapping).\n\nFor the sake of providing a complete query based on the given information and the requested format, we'll correct this oversight by assuming the OpenAlex identifier for Vladimir B. is indeed known and can be directly used in the query.\n\nHere's the corrected query to reflect the actual task of finding co-authors (considering the mapping might not directly apply as previously assumed):\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX semo: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer\nWHERE {\n  ?x semo:hasAuthorship ?answer .\n  ?x dbo:orcidId ?author .\n  ?author dbo:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\" .\n  FILTER(?answer != \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\")\n}\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, given the initial information and the ER2 mapping provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the DBLP information to OpenAlex without clear mappings of entities. The query as constructed is based on an assumption of direct correlation that isn't fully supported by the given ER2 mapping.\n\nTo accurately answer the question with the given information and follow the format exactly as requested, the corrected and accurate query should reflect the actual mapping and information available. Given the constraints and aiming to provide a query that could potentially work within the given framework (even though there's a mismatch in direct application), the query above attempts to align with the requested format, acknowledging the initial interpretation might not fully capture the intended mapping.\n\nGiven the confusion and to provide a more accurate reflection of the task at hand (and adhering strictly to the requested format), the corrected and highlighted SPARQL query for KG2, assuming we are looking for co-authors with the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-9446\" in OpenAlex, is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX semo: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbo: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer\nWHERE {\n  ?x semo:hasAuthorship ?answer .\n  ?x dbo:orcidId ?author .\n  FILTER(?answer != ?author)\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query attempts to find all entities in OpenAlex that have an authorship to another entity, excluding the entity itself. However, note that without a clear mapping of the entity of interest (Vladimir B.) to an OpenAlex identifier or a direct relation in the ER2 mapping, this query might not directly apply or might need further adjustments based on actual data and mappings."

We are interested in finding the titles of the papers that Besser, Karl-Ludwig published and in which venues.\n\nGiven this information, we can construct a SPARQL query for KG2 as follows:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?firstanswer ?secondanswer WHERE {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1597-8963> .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation> ?firstanswer .\n  ?x <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?secondanswer .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that the publication information is mapped to both \"hasLocation\" and \"hasSource\" in OpenAlex. To account for this, we can modify the query to include both predicates:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?firstanswer ?secondanswer WHERE {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1597-8963> .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation> ?firstanswer .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource> ?firstanswer .\n  ?x <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?secondanswer .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query will return the titles of the papers and the venues where Besser, Karl-Ludwig published them."

The mapping indicates the following:\n\n- The ORCID ID of the author Wan, X. is \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-1994\".\n- The relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#authoredBy>` in DBLP is mapped to `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor` in OpenAlex.\n- The relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#publishedIn>` in DBLP is mapped to `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation` and `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource` in OpenAlex.\n- The relation `<https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#title>` in DBLP is mapped to `http://purl.org/dc/terms/title` in OpenAlex.\n\nGiven these mappings and the fact that we want to find where Wan, X. published papers and the titles of these papers, we can construct the SPARQL query as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?location ?title WHERE {\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-1994> .\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource> ?location .\n    ?x <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?title .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since we're looking for publications, we might want to filter for sources that are publications (e.g., journals, conferences). Without further information about how to filter for publications in the OpenAlex KG, the above query will return all sources associated with Wan, X., regardless of whether they are publications or not.\n\nTo accurately reflect the query you requested, including the specific venue (publication) information, we need more information about how to filter for publications in OpenAlex. Assuming we can filter for publications based on some predicate (e.g., `https://semopenalex.org/ontology/isPublication`), the query could be adjusted as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?location ?title WHERE {\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6887-1994> .\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/isPublication> ?isPublication .\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource> ?location .\n    ?x <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> ?title .\n    OPTIONAL { ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasLocation> ?location } .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, without specific predicates for publications in OpenAlex, the above queries may not accurately filter for publications.\n\nIf we need to adjust our approach based on the actual predicates available for publications in OpenAlex, we would need to replace `?isPublication` with the actual predicate for publications.\n\nIf we assume that we cannot filter specifically for publications and must return all sources, the original query remains the best choice given the current information."

We also need to replace the DBLP PIDs with their corresponding ORCIDs.\n\nFrom the ER2 mapping, we see that:\n\n- William L. Kocay's DBLP PID \"https://dblp.org/pid/k/WilliamKocay\" maps to the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6689-4911\".\n- Emiliano Dall'Anese's DBLP PID \"https://dblp.org/pid/45/7883\" maps to the ORCID \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-7477\".\n- The relation \"authoredBy\" in DBLP maps to the relation \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\" in OpenAlex.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex):\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  PREFIX orcid: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n  PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n  ASK {\n    ?x semoa:hasAuthorship orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6689-4911\" .\n    ?x semoa:hasAuthorship orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-7477\" .\n  }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, the question asks if William L. Kocay and Emiliano Dall'Anese co-authored a paper. To ask this question, we need to check if the same work has both authors. \n\nIf we assume that the work is identified by a unique URI, we can modify the query to check if the two authors are both associated with the same work:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  PREFIX orcid: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n  PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n  ASK {\n    ?work a semoa:Work .\n    ?work semoa:hasAuthor orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6689-4911\" .\n    ?work semoa:hasAuthor orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-7477\" .\n  }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nBut this query is still not what we want. We want to check if there exists a work that has both authors. We can use the OPTIONAL keyword to check this:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  PREFIX orcid: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n  PREFIX semoa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\n  ASK {\n    ?work a semoa:Work .\n    ?work semoa:hasAuthor orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6689-4911\" .\n    OPTIONAL { ?work semoa:hasAuthor orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-7477\" } .\n    FILTER (BOUND(?work))\n  }\n</sparql>\n```"

To find the papers, we need to join this query with the papers in OpenAlex.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?paper\nWHERE {\n  orcid:0000-0001-8915-6658 oa:hasAuthorship ?paper .\n  ?paper oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-9847-0590 .\n}\n```\n\nTo complete the query, we need to add a subquery to find the papers that have both Ioanna Chouvarda and Carvalho, Paulo as authors. However, we cannot do this directly in a single query. \n\nInstead, we can first find the ORCID IDs of the authors in the papers co-authored by Ioanna Chouvarda and Carvalho, Paulo, and then find the papers that have both of these ORCID IDs as authors.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?paper\nWHERE {\n  ?paper oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0001-8915-6658 .\n  ?paper oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-9847-0590 .\n  ?paper oa:hasAuthorship ?auth .\n  ?auth oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0001-8915-6658 .\n  ?auth oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-9847-0590 .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query will still not give us the correct result because it will return the papers that have Ioanna Chouvarda and Carvalho, Paulo as authors, but not necessarily as authors of the same paper.\n\nTo find the papers that have both Ioanna Chouvarda and Carvalho, Paulo as authors, we need to use a more complex query that joins the `hasAuthorship` relation with the `hasAuthor` relation.\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?paper\nWHERE {\n  ?paper oa:hasAuthorship ?auth .\n  ?auth oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0001-8915-6658 .\n  ?auth oa:hasAuthor orcid:0000-0002-9847-0590 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will give us the papers that have both Ioanna Chouvarda and Carvalho, Paulo as authors."

Map the \"authoredBy\" relation in DBLP to the \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\" relation in OpenAlex.\n\nGiven the instruction to use the ORCID \"https://dbpedia.org/ontology/orcidId\" as the author, we need to adjust the mapping for the author relation. However, since the ORCID is already provided, we can directly use it in the query without needing a mapping for it.\n\nHere's how we can construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex):\n\n```sparql\nASK {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577> .\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616> .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, considering the original question is about whether a paper was **not** co-authored by Luigi Chisci and N. Forti, we need to construct the query to find papers that do not have both authors. This can be achieved by using the `FILTER` expression to check if there are papers that have one but not both authors.\n\n```sparql\nASK {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577> ;\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616> .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n      <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577> ;\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n      <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616> .\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the above query does not make sense because it checks if there are two authorship relations on the same subject, which contradicts the original intention of checking for papers that are not co-authored by both individuals.\n\nTo correctly answer the question, we should look for papers that have the first author but not the second, and papers that have the second author but not the first. We can do this by using two separate `FILTER NOT EXISTS` clauses:\n\n```sparql\nASK {\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577> .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n      <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616> .\n  }\n  UNION\n  ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n    <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5510-1616> .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?x <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship> \n      <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-3577> .\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis query correctly finds papers that are not co-authored by both Luigi Chisci and N.

We're looking for papers authored by K. Chen (https://dblp.org/pid/47/6529-11) and Adrian Dumitrescu (https://dblp.org/pid/69/5787).\n\nFirst, we map the entities from DBLP to their corresponding ORCID identifiers in OpenAlex using the ER2 mapping:\n\n1. K. Chen (DBLP: https://dblp.org/pid/47/6529-11) maps to ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5470-6621\n2. Adrian Dumitrescu (DBLP: https://dblp.org/pid/69/5787) maps to ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1118-0321\n\nThen, we need to use the ORCID in the OpenAlex query to find papers authored by these individuals. However, since we are looking for papers, not authors, and the provided ER2 mapping does not directly map DBLP papers to OpenAlex papers, we will need to query OpenAlex using the ORCID and target the \"hasAuthorship\" or \"hasAuthor\" relation to find papers.\n\nThe \"hasAuthorship\" and \"hasAuthor\" relations in OpenAlex correspond to the \"authoredBy\" relation in DBLP, which is what we are using as the basis of our query. This suggests we're looking for papers that either directly map to the ORCID of the authors or are indirectly linked through the authorship relations.\n\nGiven this, our SPARQL query for OpenAlex (KG2) should look for papers that have K. Chen or Adrian Dumitrescu as authors. However, we must adjust our approach since we are given an entity-relation mapping and not a direct mapping of papers. Therefore, we will target the ORCID identifiers directly in OpenAlex.\n\nHere's how we can construct the query:\n\n- First, we find the ORCID identifiers for K. Chen and Adrian Dumitrescu.\n- Then, we query OpenAlex for papers associated with these ORCID identifiers.\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?answer WHERE {\n  ?paper <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5470-6621>.\n  ?paper <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthor> <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1118-0321>.\n  ?answer <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/isExampleOf> ?paper.\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, this query directly targets the ORCID identifiers for the authors and the \"hasAuthor\" relation, which is not how we typically query for papers in OpenAlex. To accurately reflect the task, we should be targeting the actual papers and their relations in OpenAlex. But since the direct mapping of papers isn't available, we'll query the ORCID identifiers as a proxy.\n\nIf you're looking to query directly for papers in OpenAlex without the ORCID proxy, you would need the specific IDs of the papers authored by K. Chen and Adrian Dumitrescu in the format used in OpenAlex. Without these, the query above uses the ORCID as a proxy to find associated papers.\n\nTo clarify, the original instruction aimed to find papers that K. Chen and Adrian Dumitrescu published, but the provided ER2 mapping and the context of the query suggest we're working with a simplified scenario. For a more accurate and comprehensive query in OpenAlex, you would need the specific paper IDs or a different mapping that links DBLP papers to OpenAlex papers directly.\n\nGiven the information, the corrected approach to directly use the ORCID identifiers in the query was demonstrated. However, typically, you would query the OpenAlex for papers using their IDs if available or if there's a direct mapping from DBLP papers to OpenAlex papers."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex) based on the given context and entity relation mapping, we first need to identify the relevant mapping for the entity and relation of interest. \n\nGiven that we are interested in the average number of co-authors for papers published by E. G. Omodeo and we have a mapping from DBLP to OpenAlex, we can use the mapping provided for the ORCID of E. G. Omodeo and the relation that corresponds to authoredBy in DBLP, which is hasAuthorship in OpenAlex.\n\nHowever, since the relation for the number of creators in DBLP is not directly mappable to OpenAlex, we cannot directly query for the number of creators. We need to adjust our approach to query for the authorship and then aggregate the number of co-authors from there.\n\nGiven this, the query would need to aggregate the number of authors for each paper authored by E. G. Omodeo and then calculate the average number of authors across those papers.\n\nHere is the SPARQL query for KG2 (OpenAlex):\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer)\nWHERE {\n  ?x oa:hasAuthorship ?y .\n  ?y orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-1942\" .\n  OPTIONAL { ?y oa:hasAuthorship ?z } .\n  BIND(COUNT(DISTINCT ?z) AS ?count)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query does not directly match the desired outcome since it aggregates the number of authors for each paper but not across all papers. To correct this, we need to adjust the query to properly aggregate the number of co-authors across all papers.\n\nSince the direct relation for the number of creators is not mapped, we can infer that the number of co-authors for each paper is essentially the number of authors minus one (the author in question). Thus, the correct SPARQL query to calculate the average number of co-authors is actually a bit more complex due to the need to correctly identify and aggregate the number of authors for each paper.\n\nGiven the limitations in direct mapping and the need to calculate an average based on an indirect relationship, let's correct the approach with the proper query to find the average number of co-authors:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer)\nWHERE {\n  ?x oa:hasAuthorship ?y .\n  ?y orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-1942\" .\n  OPTIONAL { ?y oa:hasAuthorship ?z } .\n  BIND(IF(?z, COUNT(DISTINCT ?z), 0) AS ?count)\n}\n```\n\nThis query still doesn't perfectly align with the DBLP query as it was simplified due to the indirect mapping and the lack of direct relation for the number of creators in OpenAlex. However, it attempts to address the requirement by aggregating the number of co-authors based on the indirect relation and the inferred logic of counting authors for each paper.\n\nTo better match the original DBLP query's intent and considering the indirect mapping, we need to refine our approach further. Given the indirect mapping and the simplification, a more accurate query would directly involve querying for the number of authors for each paper authored by E. G. Omodeo and then calculating the average. \n\nHowever, without a direct relation for the number of creators and considering the need for an accurate answer, a more precise query to directly calculate the average number of co-authors based on the provided information and mappings would be challenging. The query above attempts to tackle the issue with the provided mappings but might not fully align with the expected outcome.\n\nTo correct and finalize the query, given the constraints and the need for a more precise calculation based on the authorship relation and considering the ORCID for E. G. Omodeo:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX orcid: <https://orcid.org/>\nPREFIX oa: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT (AVG(?count) AS ?answer)\nWHERE {\n  ?x oa:hasAuthorship ?y .\n  ?y orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-1942\" .\n  OPTIONAL { ?y oa:hasAuthorship ?z } .\n  BIND(IF(?z, COUNT(DISTINCT ?z), 0) AS ?count)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query is an attempt to directly calculate the average number of co-authors for papers by E. G. Omodeo in OpenAlex, considering the provided mappings and logic for counting authors. However, due to the indirect mapping and the simplification, the actual calculation might differ slightly from the intended outcome based on the DBLP query."

Safyannikov published and in which venues. Since we don't have direct information about Nikolay M. Safyannikov's ORCID in the ER2, we'll assume that the ORCID provided earlier is associated with the author.\n\nHere's the corrected query with the author's ID matching the information provided, and the variable names changed to match the desired output:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX orcid: <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX hasAuthorship: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasAuthorship>\nPREFIX hasSource: <https://semopenalex.org/ontology/hasSource>\nPREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT ?title ?venue\nWHERE {\n  ?x orcid:orcidId \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5424-0881\" .\n  ?x hasAuthorship ?y .\n  ?y hasSource ?venue .\n  ?y dc:title ?title .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query will return the titles and venues of the papers by the specified author, based on the ontology provided."
