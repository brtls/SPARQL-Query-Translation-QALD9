        "sparql_query_raw": "To find the highest mountain in Italy in DBpedia, we can use the following SPARQL query:\n\n`SELECT ?mountain WHERE { ?mountain rdfs:label \"highest mountain\"@en ; dbo:location ?location . ?location rdfs:label \"Italy\"@en . }`\n\nHowever, this query is not very efficient, as it relies on string matching. A more efficient approach would be to use the `wdt:P625` property in Wikidata to get the highest mountain, and then query DBpedia to get the corresponding mountain in DBpedia.\n\nHere is the revised SPARQL query:\n\n`sparql`\n`SELECT ?mountain WHERE { ?mountain wdt:P625 ?height . SERVICE wikibase:service { bd:serviceParam wikibase:service \"wbgetentities\". } }`\n`sparql`\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the highest mountain in Italy, we need to add another condition to the query. Unfortunately, Wikidata does not provide a direct link between mountains and countries. We can use the `dbr:Italy` property to get the country and then join it with the mountain. \n\nHere is the revised SPARQL query:\n\n`sparql`\n`SELECT ?mountain WHERE { ?mountain wdt:P625 ?height ; wdt:P31/wdt:P402 ?italianMountain . ?italianMountain wdt:P17 dbr:Italy . }`\n`sparql`\n\nHowever, I was unable to find a way to link the mountain to Italy directly in DBpedia, so I'll use the `p130` property (mountain in a country) to join the mountain to Italy.\n\nHere is the final, complete SPARQL query:\n\n`sparql`\n`SELECT ?mountain WHERE { ?mountain p130 ?italianMountain . ?italianMountain rdfs:label ?mountainLabel . FILTER (lang(?mountainLabel) = \"en\"). ?italianMountain p131 dbr:Italy . }`\n`sparql`"
