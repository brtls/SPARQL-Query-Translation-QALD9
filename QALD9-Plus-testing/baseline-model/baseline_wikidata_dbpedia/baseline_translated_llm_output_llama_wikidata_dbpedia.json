DBpedia entities are typically prefixed with `dbr:` instead of `wd:`. The properties would also be prefixed with `dbpedia-owl:` or the specific property URI.\n\nFor the date of the shooting, we assume that in DBpedia, it is represented by `dbpedia-owl:deathDate`.\n\nHere's how we can map the Wikidata query to DBpedia:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?deathDate\nWHERE {\n  ?item a dbpedia-owl:Person .\n  ?item dbpedia-owl:assassination dbr:Assassination_of_Olof_Palme .\n  ?item dbpedia-owl:deathDate ?deathDate .\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since the original Wikidata query was not provided, let's assume it was something like this, which is a common pattern for searching entities and their dates:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?date\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5.\n  ?item wdt:P175 wd:Q787891.\n  ?item wdt:P580 ?date.\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nTo make a DBpedia query that matches the entities and properties of the Wikidata query above, we adjust the prefixes and the properties as necessary. However, without the exact original Wikidata query, the direct mapping is not possible.\n\nLet's assume we want to search for \"Olof Palme\" and his assassination (or death) date in DBpedia. Here's an example query that does this:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?deathDate\nWHERE {\n  ?item dbo:assassination dbr:Assassination_of_Olof_Palme .\n  ?item dbo:deathDate ?deathDate .\n  FILTER(lang(?itemLabel) = \"en\").\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query looks for the entity associated with the \"Assassination of Olof Palme\" and then filters for the entity's death date. However, please note that the actual query might need adjustments based on the exact structure and entities in DBpedia that correspond to the Wikidata entities and properties mentioned in the original query.\n\n**Final SPARQL query for DBpedia (KG2) with the correct information:**\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?deathDate\nWHERE {\n  ?item rdf:type dbo:Person .\n  ?item dbo:assassination dbr:Assassination_of_Olof_Palme .\n  ?item dbo:deathDate ?deathDate .\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query should give you the death date of Olof Palme based on the DBpedia data."

This requires a subquery or UNION in the SPARQL query to account for this dual nature of the subject entities.\n2. **Predicate**: We need to identify properties that indicate a person is a trumpet player and another property that indicates they were a bandleader. \n   - For trumpet player: `rdf:type` with the class `Musician` or more specifically `trumpet` (if available in DBpedia).\n   - For bandleader: This might be a role property such as `Instrumentalist` or more directly if there's a specific property like `bandleader` or `leader_of_band` (if it exists in DBpedia).\n3. **Object**: The objects of interest are the trumpet players who were bandleaders.\n4. **Query Structure**: Since DBpedia uses a broader schema than Wikidata, we'll need to query for musicians who are also bandleaders and filter those who specifically play the trumpet.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's a SPARQL query that could be used to fetch the desired information from DBpedia:\n\n```\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?name\nWHERE {\n  {\n    SELECT ?name ?name\n    WHERE {\n      ?artist dbr:Instrumentalist ?role.\n      ?artist rdf:type dbo:Musician .\n      ?artist dbr:trumpet .\n      ?artist rdfs:label ?name.\n    }\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    SELECT ?name ?name\n    WHERE {\n      ?leader dbo:instrument dbo:Trumpet .\n      ?leader rdf:type dbo:Musician .\n      ?leader rdfs:label ?name.\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, because the `bandleader` or specific `leader_of_band` property isn't directly available in the query, and considering the complexity of adding such a property in a query, we might need to rely on more general properties that imply a leadership or bandleader role. The query above is simplified and may require adjustments to accurately reflect the entities of interest.\n\n**The final query tailored for DBpedia and highlighting the query within tags:**\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?name\nWHERE {\n  {\n    SELECT ?name ?name\n    WHERE {\n      ?artist dbr:Instrumentalist ?role.\n      ?artist rdf:type dbo:Musician .\n      ?artist dbr:trumpet .\n      ?artist rdfs:label ?name.\n    }\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    SELECT ?name ?name\n    WHERE {\n      ?leader dbo:instrument dbo:Trumpet .\n      ?leader rdf:type dbo:Musician .\n      ?leader rdfs:label ?name.\n    }\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The general approach to answering this question involves querying the causes of death and then finding the most frequent ones.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the properties in DBpedia that are relevant to causes of death and how they relate to the concept of frequency. We'll assume that the properties we need are available in DBpedia.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to creating the SPARQL query:\n\n1. Identify the property for cause of death: In Wikidata, `P268` is often associated with causes of death. We'll assume a similar property exists in DBpedia.\n   \n2. Identify the property for frequency: Since we're not given direct access to DBpedia's schema, we'll assume the need for a property that indicates frequency or occurrence rate.\n   \n3. Aggregate the results based on frequency: This typically involves grouping by the cause of death and counting the occurrences.\n\nHowever, without access to DBpedia's schema, we can't directly map these properties. For the sake of demonstration, let's assume `dbr:Cause_of_death` and `dbr:Frequency` are the properties we're looking for, which is not accurate without direct access to the DBpedia schema.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the SPARQL query would look something like this:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?causeOfDeath (COUNT(?causeOfDeath) AS ?frequency)\nWHERE {\n  ?s rdf:type dbr:Cause_of_death.\n  ?s owl:sameAs ?o.\n  ?o dbr:Frequency ?frequencyValue.\n  FILTER regex(str(?o), 'death')\n}\nGROUP BY ?causeOfDeath\nORDER BY DESC(?frequency)\n</sparql>\n\nThis query is hypothetical and assumes properties and relationships that might not exist in DBpedia. Real-world usage would require identifying the actual properties and relationships in DBpedia to accurately query causes of death and their frequencies.\n\n**Note:** The above query is a hypothetical example and may not work as-is in a real DBpedia query environment.

Here's a hypothetical SPARQL query that would look for this information in DBpedia, where `wdt:P31` refers to the instance of property (the building) and `Q104` is the Yokohama Marine Tower entity:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\n\nSELECT ?height\nWHERE {\n  dbr:Yokohama_Marine_Tower a dbo:Building .\n  dbr:Yokohama_Marine_Tower dbo:heightInMeters ?height .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nPlease note, this is a highly speculative query based on the assumption of DBpedia's internal structure and property names. It might not work as is because of differences in how properties are named and structured between Wikidata and DBpedia. Typically, you would need to consult DBpedia's schema or documentation to learn how it represents height-related information.\n\nIf you're trying to perform a real query, ensure you have the correct property name (e.g., `heightInMeters`) and that it's correctly linked to the Yokohama Marine Tower entity in DBpedia."

In this case, we are given that the knowledge graphs are Wikidata (KG1) and DBpedia (KG2). \n\n2. We need to find out how the entity in Wikidata is represented in DBpedia. Since both are knowledge graphs, they generally have similar structure, but different names for entities.\n\n3. Based on the context, we know the subject of the query is Albert Einstein. In Wikidata, the entity for Albert Einstein is Q937. \n\n4. In DBpedia, the entity for Albert Einstein would be of the form dbpedia:Albert_Einstein. However, since we are using SPARQL, we don't actually need to know the exact DBpedia name for Albert Einstein because we can query all entities that are described by the Wikidata entity.\n\n5. We need to identify the property in DBpedia that corresponds to the doctoral supervisor in Wikidata. This is likely to be a property that has the inverse relationship to the one in Wikidata, which is \"doctoral supervisor of\".\n\n6. The SPARQL query to fetch this information from DBpedia would be structured around the following steps:\n\n- Find the DBpedia entity corresponding to the doctoral supervisor of Albert Einstein.\n- This would involve querying the Wikidata entity for the doctoral supervisor and then finding the equivalent entity in DBpedia.\n\nConsidering the above steps, here's how the SPARQL query could look:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?supervisor\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q937 wdt:P69 ?supervisor.\n  SERVICE wikibase:serviceLink {\n    dbpedia:Albert_Einstein wdt:P69 ?supervisor.\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query uses the SPARQL service link provided by Wikibase to query DBpedia. This is necessary because we can't directly query across knowledge graphs in a single SPARQL query, but the service link allows us to interact with the other graph through the service. The `wdt:P69` property corresponds to the doctoral supervisor relationship in Wikidata, and the corresponding property in DBpedia will be used to fetch the supervisor of Albert Einstein."

The query should identify Donald Trump's main business entity in the DBpedia Knowledge Graph. \n\nWe can start by querying for entities related to Donald Trump. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Get the Wikidata ID for Donald Trump**: Since we have information from Wikidata (KG1), we can use this to find Donald Trump's equivalent entity in DBpedia. Wikidata provides a QID (Q123456) for individuals, and DBpedia often has a matching URI (e.g., https://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump).\n\n2. **Link Donald Trump's Wikidata ID to DBpedia**: We would typically use the `wikidata_id` property in DBpedia to find the corresponding DBpedia resource. However, this query will focus on directly querying DBpedia for Donald Trump's main business.\n\n3. **Find Donald Trump's main business in DBpedia**: Assuming DBpedia has a property or a class that denotes \"main business\" or something similar, we would query for entities that are related to Donald Trump as his main business.\n\nConsidering these steps, here's a simplified SPARQL query for DBpedia that starts by looking up Donald Trump and then seeks his main business. This is a simplified example and you may need to adjust it based on the actual properties and relations used in DBpedia.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?business\nWHERE {\n  ?business a dbpedia-owl:Company.\n  ?business rdfs:label ?label.\n  ?business dbpedia2:founder <https://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Trump>.\n  FILTER (lang(?label) = 'en' && regex(?label, 'Trump'))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nPlease note, this is a simplified query. The actual query may need to be more complex, taking into account the nuances of DBpedia's data structure and the specific properties or relations used to link people to their businesses. \n\nThis example focuses on companies founded by Donald Trump; you may need to adjust the query based on the specific business entity you're looking for (e.g., a specific company name, industry, etc.)."

We'll use the `skos:broader` property to find the parent concept, which is the continent, and then use the `dcterms:population` property to find the population of that continent.\n\nTo do this, we can write the following SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>\nPREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?population\nWHERE {\n  ?continent a skos:Concept ;\n             skos:prefLabel \"Eurasia\"@en ;\n             skos:broader ?parent .\n  ?parent a skos:Concept ;\n          dcterms:population ?population .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query doesn't directly give us the population of Eurasia.

For a specific query about Shakespeare, we would need to know his Wikidata ID or use a more specific query.\n\nAssuming we know Shakespeare's Wikidata ID (Q339978), we can modify the query to specifically ask for his death date:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?deathDate\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q339978 wdt:P20 ?deathDate.\n}\n```\n\nThis query directly asks for the death date of the item with ID Q339978, which is Shakespeare.\n\nHowever, if we want to translate this query to DBpedia, considering we're dealing with a different knowledge graph and possibly different identifiers for the same entities, we need to adjust the query.

However, for a more accurate mapping to DBpedia, we would look for entities like `dbo:Advertising` or `wikidata:Q699` subcategories related to advertising.\n\n3. **Write the Query**: The query will involve finding all DBpedia entities (companies) that are related to the advertising industry. Since we're translating from Wikidata, we'll need to look at the equivalent classes and properties in DBpedia. Specifically, we are looking for entities that are instances of a class related to advertising and companies.\n\nHere is a sample SPARQL query that could be used to achieve this, though note that the exact query may need adjustments based on the specific data models and property names used in DBpedia:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?company\nWHERE {\n  ?company a dbo:Company;\n            dbpedia-owl:industry ?industry.\n  ?industry a dbo:Industry;\n            rdfs:label ?industryLabel.\n  FILTER (regex(?industryLabel, \"advertising\", \"i\")).\n}\n```\n\nThis query looks for all entities (`?company`) that are both a `dbo:Company` and have an `industry` property that matches one with a label containing \"advertising\" (case-insensitive). The `FILTER` clause is used to match the label of the industry with \"advertising\" to ensure we're capturing the right type of industry.\n\n**Final, Complete SPARQL Query**:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?company\nWHERE {\n  ?company a dbo:Company;\n            dbpedia-owl:industry ?industry.\n  ?industry a dbo:Industry;\n            rdfs:label ?industryLabel.\n  FILTER (regex(?industryLabel, \"advertising\", \"i\")).\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Since the query is based on a conversion from Wikidata's SPARQL query, we'll be focusing on translating the entities and relationships to DBpedia's format.\n\nHere's a general approach:\n\n1. Identify the entity in Wikidata: Neil Patrick Harris\n2. Identify the relationships in Wikidata that involve Neil Patrick Harris and are relevant to TV shows\n3. Translate these relationships to DBpedia\n\nGiven the complexity of the query and the need for precision, let's break down the key components of what we're looking for in DBpedia and translate them into SPARQL query terms.\n\nHowever, for practical purposes, and without direct access to the Wikidata SPARQL query provided in the context, we'll need to start with general assumptions and aim to adapt and refine based on the relationships that are defined in DBpedia.\n\nAssuming the relationships in Wikidata involve Neil Patrick Harris being a part of \"actor\" or \"role\" properties associated with TV shows, we can infer that in DBpedia, this information would be represented through properties such as \"partOfSeries\", \"actor\", or \"memberOf\". The exact properties and their namespaces (e.g., dbpedia.org/ontology/) will be crucial for the query.\n\nHere's a basic attempt to construct a DBpedia SPARQL query based on the given scenario:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?tvShow\nWHERE {\n  Neil_Patrick_Harris a dbpedia-owl:Actor.\n  FILTER (isLiteral(?tvShow) != true).\n  Neil_Patrick_Harris dbpedia-owl:partOfSeries|dbpedia-owl:memberOf|dbpedia-owl:actor ?tvShow.\n}\n```\n\nThis query attempts to find TV shows that Neil Patrick Harris is associated with. However, the exact query might require adjustment based on the specific properties used in DBpedia and the exact relationships between Neil Patrick Harris and TV shows.\n\n**Final Note:** This query is a starting point and might not directly work without adjustments based on the actual DBpedia schema and properties used for Neil Patrick Harris and TV shows. The query's effectiveness would depend on the accuracy of the inferred relationships and the properties used in DBpedia.\n\n**Final, Complete SPARQL Query:**\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?tvShow\nWHERE {\n  Neil_Patrick_Harris a dbpedia-owl:Actor.\n  FILTER (isLiteral(?tvShow) != true).\n  Neil_Patrick_Harris dbpedia-owl:partOfSeries|dbpedia-owl:memberOf|dbpedia-owl:actor ?tvShow.\n}\n</sparql>"

The data from Wikidata can be mirrored into DBpedia, making it possible to query DBpedia using the same concepts and relationships that exist in Wikidata.\n\nHowever, without direct information on how DBpedia structures its data regarding mountains and their rankings, we must make an educated guess based on common practices in Linked Data publishing.\n\nAssuming DBpedia uses similar predicates (relationships) to describe mountains and their heights as Wikidata does, we can attempt to translate the Wikidata query to DBpedia. \n\nThe Wikidata query for the second highest mountain would look something like this, based on the assumption that Wikidata's `P500` (parent) is used to indicate a peak's status as a high mountain:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P500 wd:Q30289.  # K2 (the highest mountain)\n  ?item wdt:P2046 ?height.  # Height of the mountain\n  FILTER (?height > wdt:P2046:wd:Q30288)  # Higher than the highest mountain\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item wdt:P500 wd:Q30289. }  # Not the highest mountain itself\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }\n}\n```\n\nGiven the similarity in structure between Wikidata and DBpedia, we can attempt to mirror this query into DBpedia. Assuming that DBpedia uses similar predicates for mountains and their heights, we replace the Wikidata entities and predicates with their DBpedia counterparts.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/data/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE {\n  ?item dbpedia2:parent dbpedia:K2.  # K2 (the highest mountain)\n  ?item dbpedia-owl:height ?height.  # Height of the mountain\n  FILTER (?height > dbpedia-owl:height <dbpedia:K2>).  # Higher than the highest mountain\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item dbpedia2:parent dbpedia:K2. }  # Not the highest mountain itself\n  SERVICE dbpedia:label { dbpedia2:serviceParam dbpedia:language \"en\". }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, note that the exact implementation might vary depending on how DBpedia structures its data regarding mountains and their heights. The final, complete SPARQL query for DBpedia is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/data/>\n\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE {\n  ?item dbpedia2:parent dbpedia:K2.  # K2 (the highest mountain)\n  ?item dbpedia-owl:height ?height.  # Height of the mountain\n  FILTER (?height > dbpedia-owl:height <dbpedia:K2>).  # Higher than the highest mountain\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item dbpedia2:parent dbpedia:K2. }  # Not the highest mountain itself\n  SERVICE dbpedia:label { dbpedia2:serviceParam dbpedia:language \"en\". }\n}\n</sparql>"

Here's a step-by-step approach to constructing the SPARQL query for DBpedia:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Concepts**: The question is asking for the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport. So, we need to identify the concept of \"elevation\" and \"D\u00fcsseldorf Airport\" in DBpedia.\n\n2. **Map to DBpedia Properties**: In DBpedia, the concept of elevation might be represented by a specific property, such as `elevationInMeters` or `elevationAboveSeaLevel`.\n\n3. **Map to DBpedia Entities**: We need to find the DBpedia entity corresponding to D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query**: The basic structure of a SPARQL query to retrieve the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport in DBpedia would involve:\n    - **Prefix**: To shorten the DBpedia namespace, we use a prefix.\n    - **The entity**: We specify D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n    - **The property**: We choose the elevation property.\n    - **The query**: We ask for the value of the elevation property for D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\nGiven these steps, here's a sample SPARQL query for DBpedia:\n\n```\n<prefixes>\n  <prefix dbr=\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/\"/>\n  <prefix dbpedia-owl=\"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n  <prefix xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\">\n</prefixes>\n\n<query>\n  <sparql>\n    SELECT ?elevationValue\n    WHERE {\n      <http://dbpedia.org/resource/D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport> \n        dbpedia-owl:elevationInMeters ?elevationValue .\n    }\n  </sparql>\n</query>\n```\n\nHowever, DBpedia doesn't explicitly use `dbpedia-owl:elevationInMeters` as a property in its core ontology. DBpedia often mirrors properties from Wikidata, but the properties might have different URIs. For example, Wikidata uses `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P2046` for elevation, which might be mirrored in DBpedia as `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/height`. \n\nSo, a more accurate query, considering the mirroring of properties and the actual entity names, might look like this:\n\n```\n<sparql>\n  SELECT ?elevation\n  WHERE {\n    dbr:D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport \n      dbr:height ?elevation .\n    FILTER (lang(?elevation) = 'en').\n  }\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query searches for the `dbr:height` property of the \"D\u00fcsseldorf Airport\" entity in DBpedia and returns the value of this property, assuming it's in English. This approach is more nuanced, taking into account the specifics of how properties and entities are represented in DBpedia relative to Wikidata."

This query might need adjustments based on actual DBpedia schema usage.\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nSELECT ?holiday \nWHERE {\n  ?holiday a dbpedia-owl:Event .\n  ?holiday dbpedia-owl:eventType ?eventType .\n  FILTER ( REGEX(?eventType, \"holiday\", \"i\") ) .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query assumes that events in DBpedia are associated with a type (`dbpedia-owl:eventType`) that includes the word \"holiday\". It's a simplified approach and might need adjustments to fit the actual DBpedia schema and requirements.\n\nPlease note, without actual DBpedia query examples or exact schema definitions at hand, this query is speculative and for educational purposes only. The actual query to retrieve holidays in DBpedia would likely involve consulting DBpedia documentation, examples, or even directly testing queries in DBpedia's query service."

If you are looking for a more specific query that targets Swedish holidays directly, you might need additional information or a different approach.\n\nFor a more targeted query that directly asks for holidays celebrated in Sweden, regardless of their global recognition or unique Swedish traditions, you might need to look into specific properties or categories within DBpedia that are not directly implied by the query above. This could involve more complex filtering or using categories that are specific to Swedish holidays.\n\nFor a query that accurately returns all Swedish holidays as defined within DBpedia, we'd need more specific information about the structure and properties used in DBpedia to classify or denote holidays. The above query is a simplified example and may not capture the full complexity of what constitutes a \"Swedish holiday\" in DBpedia.\n\nIf you need to adjust this query or if you have more specific requirements, please let me know."

This could involve properties from the [http://dbpedia.org/ontology/](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/) vocabulary, or others that are more specific to financial data.\n\n3. **Query Construction**: With the entity and relevant properties identified, we'll construct a SPARQL query.

Since DBpedia is an extract of Wikipedia and is highly linked to Wikidata, we can leverage the relationship between entities across both knowledge graphs.\n\nHowever, since the specific mapping of properties and classes between Wikidata and DBpedia might not be directly available without access to the specific schema of DBpedia, we'll have to make some general assumptions based on common practices in database integration and the structure of DBpedia. Let's aim to find a query that could potentially fetch data similar to what a query on Wikidata would aim to achieve concerning holidays.\n\nDBpedia's schema and how it maps to Wikidata's can vary significantly. A typical SPARQL query in DBpedia might look like this, focusing on finding holidays based on their descriptions or categories:\n\n```sparql\nprefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nprefix dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?holiday ?holidayLabel\nWHERE {\n  ?holiday a dbo:Holiday .\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }\n  OPTIONAL { ?holiday dbpedia-owl:location ?location . }\n  ?holiday rdfs:comment ?description .\n  FILTER (lang(?description) = \"en\") .\n}\n```\n\nThis query aims to find entities in DBpedia that are classified as holidays, retrieve their labels (names), optional locations, and descriptions in English. However, this query might not directly map to Wikidata's query due to differences in schema. \n\nTo make it more compatible with Wikidata's query structure, we'd ideally need more specific information about how DBpedia structures its holiday data. Without this information, the query would need significant adjustments or might not be fully accurate. \n\nFor practical purposes, if you're working directly with DBpedia and have its schema and mapping to Wikidata, you could use a similar pattern but adjust the properties and classes to match DBpedia's structure. \n\nRemember, the key is understanding the schema of both knowledge graphs and adjusting the SPARQL query accordingly. This example is a simplified approach and might require adjustments based on the actual properties and relationships available in DBpedia for holiday data."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for DBpedia that retrieves movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola, we first need to find the equivalent entity in DBpedia for Francis Ford Coppola and then link it to the movie directors in DBpedia. Here's the approach:\n\n1. **Find the equivalent entity in DBpedia for Francis Ford Coppola**: We'll start by finding the URI or identifier for Francis Ford Coppola in DBpedia. Let's assume we find that his identifier in DBpedia is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Ford_Coppola`.\n\n2. **Link the entity to movie directors**: In DBpedia, movie directors are often described using predicates related to their work, such as `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director`. We will use this predicate to link the director to movies.\n\n3. **Retrieve movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola**: We will then use a query to retrieve movies where Francis Ford Coppola is identified as the director.\n\nHere's how these steps can be combined into a SPARQL query:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\n\nSELECT ?movie\nWHERE {\n  ?director a dbpedia-owl:Person .\n  ?director dbpedia-owl:director ?film .\n  ?film a dbpedia-owl:Film .\n  ?film rdfs:label ?movieLabel .\n  FILTER (regex(str(?director), \"Francis Ford Coppola\"))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query assumes that the equivalent entity in DBpedia for Francis Ford Coppola's identifier is used directly (e.g., `dbpedia:Francis_Ford_Coppola`). If you have the actual URI for Francis Ford Coppola in DBpedia, you should replace `dbpedia:Francis_Ford_Coppola` with your actual URI.\n\nHowever, given the original instruction and the context of Wikidata, it's more accurate to use the Wikidata ID for Francis Ford Coppola to query DBpedia, especially if there's a direct link between the two entities. The query above is a simplified representation based on the information provided.\n\nTo make the query more accurate and based on the direct link between Wikidata and DBpedia entities, you might need to adjust it according to the specific entity URIs and their links within the two knowledge graphs.\n\nIf you have the Wikidata ID for Francis Ford Coppola (e.g., `Q9`), and assuming there's a direct property in DBpedia that relates Wikidata entities to DBpedia entities (for example, `dbpedia-owl:wikidata_id`), the query could look more like this:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wikibase: <http://wikibase.org/ontology#>\n\nSELECT ?movie\nWHERE {\n  ?director wikibase:wikiLink ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?director wdt:P345 ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?film dbpedia-owl:director ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?film a dbpedia-owl:Film .\n  ?film rdfs:label ?movieLabel .\n  FILTER (regex(str(?dbpediaDirector), \"Francis_Ford_Coppola\"))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query is based on assumptions about the direct link between WD entities and DBpedia entities and might need adjustments based on actual property names and usage.\n\nThe final, complete SPARQL query to retrieve movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola, assuming direct links between entities based on the original context, is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?movie\nWHERE {\n  ?director wikibase:wikiLink ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?director wdt:P345 ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?film dbpedia-owl:director ?dbpediaDirector .\n  ?film a dbpedia-owl:Film .\n  ?film rdfs:label ?movieLabel .\n  FILTER (regex(str(?dbpediaDirector), \"Francis_Ford_Coppola\"))\n}\n</sparql>\n\nPlease adjust the query based on the actual property names and usage in your knowledge graphs."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (DBpedia) based on the given context, we need to determine how the information about the first Queen album can be queried from DBpedia. This involves understanding the structure and relationships of entities and properties within DBpedia.\n\nThe property we are interested in querying is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that we are looking for an album that is associated with the band \"Queen.\" We need to find the equivalent property in DBpedia that relates an album to a band.\n\nIn DBpedia, properties related to albums and bands are often described using predicates like `dcterms:creator`, `foaf:maker`, `musicalbum:artist`, or specific music-related properties like `schema:performer` or `schema:composer`. However, without more specific information, we'll have to assume the use of a general property to link an album to its performers/composers.\n\nHere's a general approach to query for the first Queen album in DBpedia:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>\n\nSELECT ?album\nWHERE {\n  ?album a dbpedia-owl:Album .\n  ?album dcterms:creator ?band .\n  ?band schema:creator \"Queen\"@en .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query assumes that the \"Queen\" entity exists in DBpedia and is identified by the string \"Queen\"@en. For more accurate results, you would ideally use the `wd:Q` identifier of Queen in Wikidata and the equivalent identifier in DBpedia. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the specific identifiers used in DBpedia, nor can I perform queries to confirm their existence or usage.\n\nA more precise query would require the specific identifiers and relationships in DBpedia. For example, if the identifier for Queen in DBpedia is `dbpedia:Queen`, and the property to link an album to its artist is `dcterms:creator` (or any other suitable property), the query could be more directly informed.\n\nGiven the limitations and the lack of specific identifiers for the question at hand, a correct or complete query cannot be provided without further information about the exact structure of the knowledge graph and the specific identifiers used to represent entities in DBpedia.\n\nHowever, for the sake of providing a complete query as per the instruction, considering we might need to adjust the properties and identifiers to match DBpedia's structure accurately:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>\n\nSELECT ?album\nWHERE {\n  ?album a dbpedia-owl:Album .\n  ?album dcterms:creator ?band .\n  ?band schema:creator \"Queen\"@en .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query is based on assumptions that might not hold true for the actual DBpedia structure or might need adjustments based on the specific identifiers and relationships used in DBpedia."

Given that Wikidata and DBpedia are both based on the same underlying data (structured information about entities), but with different focuses and data presentation, we can indeed use DBpedia for querying. However, the entity IDs might be slightly different because DBpedia and Wikidata might have different naming conventions or ID assignments for certain entities.\n\nAssuming we are using DBpedia as our second knowledge graph and considering the query structure follows the SPARQL syntax, we can structure the query as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?person\nWHERE {\n  ?person wdt:P20 \"Vienna\" ; \n           wdt:P20 \"Berlin\" .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since the above query does not specify the correct format for entities IDs in DBpedia (which typically use the prefix `foaf:`, `dbo:`, `dbr:`, or `rdfs:` for referencing entities, depending on the context), and it also mixes the predicates (property identifiers) for birth and death places (`wdt:P20` is for birthplace in Wikidata, but we need to map this correctly to DBpedia's structure), we need to adjust our approach.\n\nDBpedia's SPARQL endpoint does not directly support using `wdt:P20`; instead, we would look for the property that represents birthplace and death place in DBpedia. In DBpedia, the property for birthplace is `foaf:birthplace`. For death place, we need to adjust our query to correctly map it to DBpedia's structure. Since we are trying to find entities that were born in Vienna and died in Berlin, we actually need to use two separate queries:\n\n1. Find entities born in Vienna.\n2. Find entities who died in Berlin.\n\nThen, intersect these two queries to get the final answer.\n\nGiven the complexity of directly mapping Wikidata's property IDs to DBpedia's, and considering DBpedia might not have direct mappings for every Wikidata property, a precise query might require knowledge of DBpedia's property names and their exact usage. However, if we strictly follow the given information and the initial query, we would need to adjust our query to reflect the correct properties in DBpedia.\n\nHowever, without the direct mapping of Wikidata's `wdt:P20` to DBpedia's property (which could be `foaf:birthplace` or another property depending on the exact entity and context), let's proceed with the assumption that we are looking for entities born in Vienna and died in Berlin, and that we know the entities' IDs in DBpedia (which would be different from Wikidata IDs).\n\nFor clarity and correctness in querying DBpedia directly, let's assume we are looking for the intersection of birthplace in Vienna and death place in Berlin using DBpedia's entity IDs, where `dbr:Vienna` and `dbr:Berlin` are the DBpedia IDs for Vienna and Berlin respectively.\n\nHere's a corrected SPARQL query to find people born in Vienna (dbr:Vienna) and died in Berlin (dbr:Berlin), assuming we have the correct property IDs in DBpedia:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\n\nSELECT ?person\nWHERE {\n  ?person foaf:birthPlace dbr:Vienna ;\n           dbo:deathPlace dbr:Berlin .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query uses DBpedia's property `foaf:birthPlace` to specify the birthplace and `dbo:deathPlace` to specify the death place, and then intersects these conditions to find the entities that were born in Vienna and died in Berlin.\n\nPlease note, you may need to adjust the property names (`foaf:birthPlace`, `dbo:deathPlace`) according to the actual property names used in DBpedia for birth and death places. The actual SPARQL query might require more complex logic or additional filtering based on the structure of the data in DBpedia."

However, since the exact predicates might differ in DBpedia, we'll need to identify the appropriate ones.\n\nAfter researching, DBpedia uses `foaf:maker` for creators and `dbpedia-owl:workType` for specifying the type of work, which can include \"television show\" or its equivalent class.\n\nHere's how we might start:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the class for \"television show\" in DBpedia. This is `dbpedia-owl:TelevisionShow` or a similar class.\n- **Step 2**: Find the property for \"creator\" or \"maker\" in DBpedia. This could be `foaf:maker` or a specific property for creators.\n\nLet's assume we found that `foaf:maker` is the property for creators and `dbpedia-owl:TelevisionShow` is the class for television shows. Here's a hypothetical start to the query, which we will refine based on the actual properties used in DBpedia.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nSELECT ?tvShow\nWHERE {\n  ?individual foaf:maker ?johnCleese .\n  ?tvShow a dbpedia-owl:TelevisionShow .\n  ?tvShow ...  # This is where we would link the individual to the television show\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the actual query needs to accurately reflect how creators are related to their television shows in DBpedia, which might not be as straightforward as the simplified example.\n\n**Without the specific DBpedia predicates for creators and television shows, we cannot provide a precise SPARQL query**. However, the process would involve:\n\n1. Identifying the correct predicates and classes in DBpedia for the entities and relationships we're interested in (creator and television show).\n2. Using these to craft a query that correctly links John Cleese to the television shows he created.\n\nFor a complete and accurate query, we would need to refer to DBpedia's schema or documentation to identify the correct properties and classes for \"creator\" and \"television show.\"\n\n**Given the hypothetical scenario and the lack of specific DBpedia predicates for creators and television shows, a final, complete SPARQL query would look something like this, assuming we've correctly identified the necessary predicates and classes:**\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nSELECT ?tvShow\nWHERE {\n  ?individual foaf:maker ?johnCleese .\n  ?tvShow a dbpedia-owl:TelevisionShow .\n  # Assuming a direct relation between the individual and the television show\n  # based on the concept of \"creator\" and \"television show\"\n  ?tvShow ...  # This might involve a specific property (e.g., \"createdBy\") if it exists\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nPlease note, this is a hypothetical example and should be adjusted based on the actual properties and classes in DBpedia.\n\nIf you're looking for an accurate query, it's highly recommended to consult DBpedia's documentation or schema directly, as the specific properties and classes used might differ from those assumed in this example."

The structure and entities in DBpedia might be different from those in Wikidata, but the general concept of querying for entities and their properties remains the same.\n\nGiven that the question is about who discovered Ceres, we're looking for a statement or property in Wikidata that links to the discoverer of Ceres. In Wikidata, this could be associated with the property `discovered_by` or something similar.\n\nHowever, translating directly from Wikidata to DBpedia without a direct mapping can be challenging. Since we don't have the specific property or entity names in DBpedia that directly match the Wikidata ones, we'll have to infer or query based on the general structure of DBpedia's data.\n\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume that the equivalent property in DBpedia for \"discovered_by\" is `discoveredBy`, and the entity for Ceres in DBpedia is `Ceres`. Please note, actual property and entity names may differ and should be determined through DBpedia's documentation or by querying it directly.\n\nHere's a hypothetical SPARQL query for DBpedia to find out who discovered Ceres, based on our assumptions:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?discoverer\nWHERE {\n  ?ceres a dbpedia-owl:Astroid .\n  ?ceres dbpedia2:discoveredBy ?discoverer .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query may not directly translate because DBpedia's schema and entity names can vary significantly from Wikidata's. This query is conceptual and may need adjustments based on the actual structure of DBpedia's data.\n\nTo get accurate results, you should consult DBpedia's documentation or directly query their endpoint with a relevant query. The query above should be taken as a starting point and may need modification to accurately reflect DBpedia's schema and entity naming conventions.\n\n**Please keep in mind that this query is hypothesized and might need adjustments for actual usage on DBpedia.**\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?discoverer\nWHERE {\n  ?ceres a dbpedia-owl:Astroid .\n  ?ceres dbpedia2:discoveredBy ?discoverer .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

DBpedia often uses different URIs and properties than Wikidata. Unfortunately, without direct access to the DBpedia schema or more information about their specific properties for the entity we want to query, it's challenging to directly translate the query. \n\nHowever, we can look up the equivalent properties in DBpedia.

This will involve finding IBM in DBpedia and then querying for its employee count.\n\nGiven IBM is a well-known entity, it should be present in DBpedia. We'll assume we're looking for its employee count, similar to the Wikidata query. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Find IBM in DBpedia**: We need to identify the entity for IBM in DBpedia. DBpedia entities are often prefixed with `dbpedia.org`, and the URI might look like `http://dbpedia.org/resource/IBM`.\n\n2. **Query for Employee Count**: Once we have the entity for IBM, we can query for information related to its employee count. This might involve querying for a property related to the number of employees, such as `dbo:employeeCount` or similar properties.\n\nHere's a hypothetical SPARQL query for DBpedia to find the employee count of IBM. Please note, the actual query might need adjustments based on the actual URI of IBM in DBpedia and the property used to denote the number of employees.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?employeeCount\nWHERE {\n  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/IBM> dbo:employeeCount ?employeeCount .\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query assumes a direct property `dbo:employeeCount` exists on IBM's entity in DBpedia. In practice, you might need to use more specific or alternative properties, and the query might need to account for the actual URI of IBM in DBpedia.\n\nKeep in mind, this is a simplified example.

If the budget is attached to the entity through a different path (e.g., through a production company or a release date), you would need to modify the query accordingly.\n\nFor a more robust query, you might need to consult DBpedia's ontology and schema to determine the precise path to the budget information."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "To produce a SPARQL query for KG2 (DBpedia) that answers the question \"What is the largest country in the world\", we need to map the question to the relevant entities and properties in DBpedia. \n\nSince Wikidata and DBpedia are knowledge graphs that share many entities and properties, we can leverage the SPARQL query in Wikidata and adapt it to DBpedia. The key challenge is to find the equivalent properties and classes in DBpedia.\n\nHere's a possible mapping:\n\n* Wikidata's `wdt:P17` (entity that is the country) is equivalent to DBpedia's `foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country`.\n* Wikidata's `wdt:P25` (area) is equivalent to DBpedia's `dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm`.\n\nBased on this mapping, we can construct a SPARQL query for DBpedia as follows:\n\n```\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nSELECT ?country\nWHERE {\n  ?country foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/\".\n  ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?area.\n  FILTER(?area > (SELECT MAX(?maxArea) AS ?maxValue\n        FROM <http://dbpedia.org>\n        WHERE { ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?maxArea })))\n  ORDER BY DESC(?area)\n  LIMIT 1\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this query might not work as expected because it tries to find the country with the maximum area among all countries in DBpedia. This might return incorrect results because of the complexity of the query and the fact that DBpedia contains a lot of countries.\n\nTo solve this problem, we should use a more efficient query that finds the country with the maximum area directly.\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?country ?area\nWHERE {\n  ?country foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country ?countryURI.\n  ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?area.\n  FILTER(?area = (SELECT MAX(?maxArea) AS ?maxValue\n        FROM <http://dbpedia.org>\n        WHERE { ?countryURI a dbpedia-owl:Country; dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?maxArea })))\n  FILTER(?countryURI = ?country)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nThis query finds the country with the maximum area by filtering the results to only include countries with the maximum area.\n\nHowever, this query might still return incorrect results if there are multiple countries with the same maximum area.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the query to find the country with the maximum area among all countries in DBpedia. However, this is a complex task that requires multiple queries and subqueries.\n\nA better approach would be to use the SPARQL query that finds the maximum area among all countries in DBpedia and then use this result to find the country with the maximum area.\n\nHere is a possible query:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?maxArea ?country\nWHERE {\n  SELECT ?country ?area\n  WHERE {\n    ?country foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country ?countryURI.\n    ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?area.\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?country ?area\n  HAVING (SUM(?area) > 0)\n  ORDER BY DESC(?area)\n  LIMIT 1\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nThis query finds the country with the maximum area by grouping all countries by their area and then selecting the country with the maximum area.\n\nNote that this is a simplified query and might need to be modified based on the actual schema of the DBpedia knowledge graph.\n\nAfter finding the country with the maximum area, we can use the following query to find the actual country:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?country\nWHERE {\n  ?country foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country ?countryURI.\n  ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?area.\n  FILTER(?area = ?maxArea)\n}\n</sparql>\n```\nThis query finds the country with the maximum area by filtering the results to only include countries with the maximum area.\n\nWe can combine these two queries to get the final result.\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query:\n\n```\n<sparql>\nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nPREFIX dbpedia-owl: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\n\nSELECT ?country\nWHERE {\n  SELECT ?country ?area\n  WHERE {\n    ?country foaf:primaryTopic/rdfs:seeAlso/dbpedia-owl:country ?countryURI.\n    ?country dbpedia-owl:areaSqKm ?area.\n  }\n  GROUP BY ?country ?area\n  HAVING (SUM(?area) > 0)\n  ORDER BY DESC(?area)\n  LIMIT 1\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Find the person entity \"Angela Merkel\" in DBpedia (KG2).\n2. Get her occupation and specifically find the entity that represents the Chancellor of Germany.\n3. Determine her alma mater.\n\nTo achieve this in DBpedia, we can use the following SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?almaMater\nWHERE {\n  ?person dbo:occupation dbo:ChancellorOfGermany.\n  ?person dbp:name \"Angela Merkel\"@en.\n  ?person dbo:almaMater ?almaMater.\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since Angela Merkel's alma mater is not directly stated in DBpedia, we need to dig deeper. This can be done by querying Wikidata (KG1) first to find Angela Merkel's alma mater and then use that information to query DBpedia. But, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume Angela Merkel's alma mater is known.\n\nAssuming Angela Merkel's alma mater is Leipzig University (which is actually correct), the query would be:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?almaMater\nWHERE {\n  ?person dbo:occupation dbo:ChancellorOfGermany.\n  ?person dbp:name \"Angela Merkel\"@en.\n  ?chancellor dbo:almaMater ?almaMater.\n  FILTER(regex(str(?almaMater),\"Leipzig\")).\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since Angela Merkel's alma mater is Leipzig University, we should include the full IRI of Leipzig University in the query. \n\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?almaMater\nWHERE {\n  ?person dbo:occupation dbo:ChancellorOfGermany.\n  ?person dbp:name \"Angela Merkel\"@en.\n  ?chancellor dbo:almaMater <http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Leipzig>.\n}\n```\n\nBut, the correct SPARQL query for the question would be one that doesn't restrict the alma mater to a specific university:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>\n\nSELECT ?almaMater\nWHERE {\n  ?person dbo:occupation dbo:ChancellorOfGermany.\n  ?person dbp:name \"Angela Merkel\"@en.\n  ?chancellor dbo:almaMater ?almaMater.\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis will return all possible alma maters of Angela Merkel, given she is the Chancellor of Germany."
