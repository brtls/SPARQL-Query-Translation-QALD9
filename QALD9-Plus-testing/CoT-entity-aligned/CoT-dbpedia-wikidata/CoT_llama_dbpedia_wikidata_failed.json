        "sparql_query_raw": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for constructing the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n1. **Identify the target entity**: The target entity is Olof Palme, which is represented by the DBpedia ID \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olof_Palme\".\n2. **Map the entity to its Wikidata ID**: Using the ER2 mapping, we find that the DBpedia ID \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olof_Palme\" is mapped to the Wikidata ID \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q53713\". We will use this Wikidata ID in our query.\n3. **Identify the property of interest**: The property of interest is the death date of Olof Palme, which is represented by the DBpedia property \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathDate\".\n4. **Map the property to its Wikidata ID**: Using the ER2 mapping, we find that the DBpedia property \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathDate\" is mapped to the Wikidata property \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P570\". We will use this Wikidata property in our query.\n5. **Construct the query**: We want to retrieve the date when Olof Palme was shot. Since the property \"deathDate\" is not directly related to the event of being shot, we will assume that the query is asking for the date of death, which is the closest related information. However, to ensure we're getting the correct information, we can include the entity that represents the event of being shot, which is \"assassination\" in this case.\n\nThe complete SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata) is:\n \n`SELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE {`\n`  ?event wdt:P31 wd:Q145243.`\n`  ?event wdt:P106 wd:Q53713.`\n`  ?event wdt:P580 ?date.`\n`  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }`\n`}`\n \n\nHere's a brief explanation of each part of the query:\n\n* `wdt:P31 wd:Q145243`: This line specifies that the event `?event` is an assassination (Q145243).\n* `wdt:P106 wd:Q53713`: This line specifies that the event `?event` is a death (Q53713) of Olof Palme (Q53713).\n* `wdt:P580 ?date`: This line retrieves the date of the event `?event`.\n* `SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\". }`: This line is used to retrieve labels for the entities in the query, but it's not essential for our query.\n\nPlease note that this query assumes that the entity \"assassination\" is represented by the Wikidata ID \"Q145243\". If this is not the case, you'll need to replace it with the correct Wikidata ID."
