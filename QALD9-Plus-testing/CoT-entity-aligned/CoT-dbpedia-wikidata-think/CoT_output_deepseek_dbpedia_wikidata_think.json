The original question is asking who the founder of Penguin Books is. The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia and some mappings to help transition this to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, let me look at the original DBpedia query. It uses the dbo:founder property to find the URI of the founder. The ER2 mappings tell me that in DBpedia, \"founder\" corresponds to Wikidata's P112. So, I should use P112 in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I need to map the resource Penguin_Books from DBpedia to Wikidata. The ER2 mappings show that Penguin_Books in DBpedia can be either Q1336200 or Q3374730 in Wikidata. So, I should include both possibilities in the query to make sure I cover all cases.\n\nIn Wikidata, the query will select the founder and will be about Penguin Books. I should use the<wikidata:Q...> prefixes for the entities. The query should ask where the subject is Penguin Books, and the predicate is P112, and then return the object, which is the founder.\n\nI think I should use a query that starts with SELECT DISTINCT to get unique results. Then, I'll define the main triple: Penguin Books (Q1336200 or Q3374730) p:P112 ?founder. I can list both Q IDs to cover both entities.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Wikidata SPARQL query will select ?founder where <wikidata:Q1336200> or <wikidata:Q3374730> have the property P112 pointing to ?founder.\n\nI should make sure there's no syntax error, using the correct prefixes and structure. I think that's pretty much it. Now, I can write the final query.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Penguin_Books\n   - **Relation:** founder\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - **Penguin_Books** is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1336200` and `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3374730`.\n   - **founder** is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/P112`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata `p` and `ps` prefixes for properties.\n   - Retrieve the founder (`?founder`) of Penguin Books using `wdoi:Q1336200` and `wdoi:Q3374730`.\n\n4. **Final Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wdoi: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?founder WHERE {\n    { wdoi:Q1336200 wds:P112 ?founder }\n    UNION\n    { wdoi:Q3374730 wds:P112 ?founder }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query fetches the founder of Penguin Books by querying both possible Wikidata entities for Penguin Books and returns the founder."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query, it's selecting all distinct ?uri where Stanley Kubrick is the director. The key entities here are Stanley Kubrick and the director relationship.\n\nNow, using the ER2 mappings provided, I can map the director relation from DBpedia (dbo:director) to Wikidata's P57. Similarly, Stanely Kubrick's DBpedia resource maps to Wikidata's Q2001.\n\nIn Wikidata, properties are often used in the form of statements, so I'll use P57 to represent the director. The structure in Wikidata usually involves two parts for each property: the property itself and the value it points to. So, I'll have ?item wdt:P57 wd:Q2001, where ?item represents each film, wdt:P57 is the directed by property, and wd:Q2001 is Stanley Kubrick.\n\nNext, I need to make sure the query returns distinct results to avoid duplicates and specify that ?item should be a dct:subject to ensure we're talking about Wikidata items. Also, adding a label for the films will make the results more readable, though it's optional.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select the film titles and their labels, filtering only for films directed by Kubrick. I'll ensure the syntax aligns with Wikidata's requirements, using the correct prefixes for RDF and RDFS, and structure the query correctly to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step process and the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations**:\n   - Director relation: `dbo:director` in DBpedia maps to `wdt:P57` in Wikidata.\n   - Stanley Kubrick: `res:Stanley_Kubrick` in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q2001` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata equivalent of the DBpedia query structure.\n   - Select movies directed by Stanley Kubrick using the mapped properties.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P57 wd:Q2001.\n  ?item rdfs:label ?itemLabel.\n  FILTER((LANGMATCHES(LANG(?itemLabel), 'en')))\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all items (films) where Stanley Kubrick is listed as the director and returns their labels in English."

Now, I need to convert this to use Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings:\n\n1. `dbo:Musical` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2743` (Musical).\n2. `dbo:musicBy` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P86` (musical), but I think P86 is \"composer.\" Maybe that's what we use.\n3. `res:Elton_John` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2808` (Elton John).\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are in the form `wd:QNUMBER` and properties are `p:PNUMBER`. So, to represent \"instance of\" in Wikidata, we use `wdt:P31`. For properties like \"composer,\" it's `wdt:P86`.\n\nSo, the query structure should be:\n\n1. Select distinct ?item\n2.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query that asks, \"Who developed Skype?\" Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the DBpedia query provided. It's using the PREFIX for dbo, res, and rdfs. The query is selecting ?uri where res:Skype has the developer property. So, the main entities here are \"Skype\" and \"developer.\"\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia resource for Skype is mapped to Wikidata's Q40984. Similarly, the DBpedia ontology for developer is mapped to Wikidata's P178, which is \"developer\" in Wikidata.\n\nNow, I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, entities are referenced with their Q and P numbers, preceded by 'wd:' and 'p:' respectively, but usually, it's directly used as Q... and P... without prefixes.\n\nThe structure of the DBpedia query is selecting the developer of Skype. In Wikidata, to get the developer, we can use the property P178. So, the query should find all entities that are developers of Skype, which is Q40984.\n\nPutting it together, I need to write a query that asks for all items where Skype (Q40984) is the subject, and the property is P178 (developer), with the value being the variable we're interested in, which would be ?developer.\n\nSo, the SPARQL query would look like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?developer WHERE {\n  wd:Q40984 p:P178 ?developer.\n}\n\nI also need to make sure that I use the correct syntax for Wikidata. Sometimes, variables might need to be defined, but in this case, the query should work as is. Let me double-check to ensure there are no syntax errors and that the prefixes are correctly handled. Since Wikidata uses 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for properties, but in the actual query, it's more common to just use the Q and P numbers directly with their namespaces already defined. However, the 'wd:' and 'p:' prefixes are often used in the query headers, so it's good practice to include them.\n\nWait, actually, in the query, I should include the PREFIX declarations for 'wd' and 'p' to map to the correct namespaces. Adding these at the beginning makes the query more readable and ensures that the endpoints understand the prefixes.\n\nSo, the final query would include the PREFIX lines, and then the SELECT statement as above. I think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The key points are mapping the entities and relations correctly from DBpedia to Wikidata using ER2, maintaining the query structure, and ensuring proper syntax and prefixes are in place.\n</think>\n\nTo answer the question of who developed Skype using Wikidata, I first mapped the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. Skype corresponds to Q40984, and the developer property corresponds to P178. Constructing the SPARQL query with these mappings gives the following result:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?developer\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q40984 p:P178 ?developer.\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm looking to transform a SPARQL query that runs on DBpedia into one that works on Wikidata. The original query aims to list all soccer clubs in the Bundesliga. Let me break down the process.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the original DBpedia query. It selects distinct URIs where the URI is a type of SoccerClub and is associated with the Bundesliga league. The key parts here are the type (SoccerClub), the relation (league), and the specific league (Bundesliga).\n\nNext, I need to map these DBpedia elements to their Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mappings. The type \"SoccerClub\" in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q476028, which is \"soccer club.\" The relation \"league\" corresponds to Wikidata's property P118, \"league.\" Lastly, \"Bundesliga\" in DBpedia maps to Q82595 in Wikidata, which refers to the Bundesliga itself.\n\nNow, translating this into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, entities are often prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:' or 'ps:' for statements. Since we're looking for soccer clubs that are in the Bundesliga, I'll use the property P118 with the Bundesliga entity as the value.\n\nPutting it all together, the Wikidata query should select all items where the item is an instance of a soccer club and has the league property set to Bundesliga. This involves using 'wd:' for the entity and 'ps:' for the property statement.\n\nI should also ensure the query is valid. In Wikidata, to specify a property's value, we use 'ps' or 'p' followed by the property number and then the value. So, using 'ps:p118' followed by 'wd:Q82595' correctly identifies the league as Bundesliga.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the query, making sure to use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates and order it by the club's label for readability. The final SPARQL should look something like selecting distinct items and their labels where the item is a soccer club and has the league set to Bundesliga, ensuring it's all properly enclosed in the necessary prefixes.\n</think>\n\nLet's construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations**:\n   - Entity: SoccerClub\n   - Relation: league\n   - Target: Bundesliga\n\n2. **Map DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata**:\n   - SoccerClub \u2192 Q476028\n   - league \u2192 P118\n   - Bundesliga \u2192 Q82595\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL query**:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 .\n  ?item p:P118 ?statement .\n  ?statement ps:P118 wd:Q82595 .\n  SERVICE wikibase:label {\n    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" .\n  }\n}\nORDER BY ?itemLabel\n</sparql>\n```\n\n**Step-by-step explanation**:\n\n1. **SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel**:\n   - Retrieves distinct items and their labels.\n\n2. **?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028**:\n   - Filters items of type \"soccer club.\"\n\n3. **?item p:P118 ?statement**:\n   - Retrieves the \"league\" property statements.\n\n4. **?statement ps:P118 wd:Q82595**:\n   - Filters statements where the \"league\" is \"Bundesliga.\"\n\n5. **SERVICE wikibase:label**:\n   - Provides human-readable labels for the items.\n\n6. **ORDER BY ?itemLabel**:\n   - Orders the results by the item labels.\n\n</sparql>\n\ud280"

I know that there's an equivalent query for DBpedia already, but I need to map that over to Wikidata. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  ?x dbo:director res:William_Shatner ; \n     dbo:starring ?uri \n}\n\nThis query is selecting all distinct URIs where a movie (?x) has both a director (William Shatner) and a starring actor (?uri). So, the key parts here are the director property, the resource for William Shatner, and the starring property.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia entities to their corresponding Wikidata identifiers using the provided ER2 mappings. Let's go through each part:\n\n1. **dbo:director (DBpedia ontology) maps to P57 in Wikidata.**\n2. **res:William_Shatner maps to Q16297 in Wikidata.**\n3. **dbo:starring (DBpedia ontology) maps to P161 in Wikidata.**\n\nWith these mappings, I can start constructing the Wikidata query. In Wikidata, properties are typically denoted with 'p:' followed by the property number, and the actual value is usually given with 'ps:' for the statement. However, in SPARQL, I can use the property directly with its IRI.\n\nSo, the structure in Wikidata would be similar to DBpedia. I need to find all entities (movies) that have William Shatner as the director and have some actor listed under starring.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the query would start with selecting the actor's URI, then define the condition that the movie was directed by William Shatner and that the actor starred in it.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?actor \nWHERE { \n  ?movie wdt:P57 wd:Q16297 ; \n         wdt:P161 ?actor \n}\n\nWait, in the initial DBpedia query, the variable for the movie was ?x, and here I'm using ?movie. Also, the actor is now ?actor instead of ?uri for clarity.\n\nI should check if this makes sense. wdt:P57 refers to the 'director' property, and wdt:P161 refers to 'starring'. So, the movie has a director (William Shatner) and a starring actor.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me make sure there are no syntax errors. The variables are correctly used, and the properties are mapped accurately.\n\nOne thing to note is that in Wikidata, the 'wdt' prefix is used for direct property access, so using wdt:P57 is appropriate for the 'director' property.\n\nSo, to summarize, I've mapped each part from DBpedia to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings and structured the SPARQL query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe process to map the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata involves identifying the corresponding entities and properties using the provided ER2 mappings and then structuring the query accordingly. Here's the final, complete SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?actor \nWHERE { \n  ?movie wdt:P57 wd:Q16297 ; \n         wdt:P161 ?actor \n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided DBpedia query. The original question is about finding the highest mountain. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the DBpedia query selects the URI of a mountain and orders them by elevation in descending order, then limits the result to one. The query is straightforward: it's looking for mountains and their elevations.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, the DBpedia ontology for Mountain is mapped to Wikidata's Q8502, which I know represents 'mountain'. Similarly, the elevation property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P2044, which is 'elevation above sea level'.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I'll need to find all entities that are instances of mountain (Q8502) and have the P2044 property for elevation. The goal is to retrieve the one with the highest elevation.\n\nI remember that in Wikidata, entities are represented with 'wd' prefixes, and properties with 'p'. But in SPARQL, it's more common to use the full URIs or the 'wds' and 'wdt' prefixes. Wait, actually, in SPARQL, for Wikidata, we use 'wd' for entities and 'p' and 'ps' for properties. Hmm, but I think the correct way is to use 'wd:' for the entity and 'p:' for the property.\n\nThe structure would be similar: select the mountain entity, filter where it's a mountain, has an elevation, order by elevation descending, and limit to one.\n\nSo, putting it together, the query should be:\n\nSELECT ?mountain WHERE {\n  ?mountain wdt:P31 wd:Q8502.\n  ?mountain wdt:P2044 ?elevation.\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n\nI should make sure that the variables are correctly named and that the properties are properly referenced. Also, ensuring that the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses are correctly placed after the WHERE clause.\n\nLet me double-check: P31 is 'instance of', which is correct because we want mountains. P2044 is the elevation. So yes, that's right.\n\nI think that's it. The query should return the highest mountain by correctly mapping the entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding elements in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. The goal is to retrieve the highest mountain by elevation.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Mountain (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mountain` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q8502`)\n   - **Relation:** Elevation (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/elevation` \u2192 Wikidata: `P2044`)\n\n2. **Map the SPARQL Query Structure:**\n   - The DBpedia query selects the URI of mountains and orders them by elevation in descending order.\n   - In Wikidata, we need to find entities of type 'mountain' with their elevation and sort them accordingly.\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `wdt:P31` to denote 'instance of' (equivalent to `a` in DBpedia).\n   - Use `wd:Q8502` for the mountain entity.\n   - Use `wdt:P2044` for elevation.\n   - Order by elevation in descending order and limit to the top result.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?mountain WHERE {\n  ?mountain wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n             wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out how many films Leonardo DiCaprio has starred in. Let's break this down step by step. I'm somewhat new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the original DBpedia query, they used `rdf:type` to identify films and `starring` to link to DiCaprio. So, I need to find the equivalent properties in Wikidata. Let me check the ER2 mappings provided.\n\nFrom the ER2, I see:\n- `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424`. So in Wikidata, this is entity Q11424.\n- `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161`, which is the property for \"starring\" in Wikidata, also known as \"cast member\".\n- `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_DiCaprio` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q38111`, which is the item for Leonardo DiCaprio in Wikidata.\n\nAlright, so in Wikidata, I'll need to look for items that are instances of \"film\", and where Leonardo DiCaprio is listed as a cast member. So the structure would be: select all items where `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424` (meaning the item is a film) and `?item wdt:P161 wd:Q38111` (Leonardo is in the cast). Then count these items.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. In DBpedia, `?uri` is the film's URI, and it's linked to the film type and the starring actor. In Wikidata, the way to express that an item is a film is through property P31 (instance of), so `wdt:P31 wd:Q11424`. Then, to find the starring actor, which is P161, `wdt:P161 wd:Q38111`.\n\nSo putting it all together, the query would look like:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c) WHERE { \n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n  ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q38111 .\n}\n\nBut I should check if this is correct. Wait, does `?item` need to be bound? Or should it be a variable that's properly introduced? Also, is P161 the correct property? I think P161 is for cast member, but sometimes there might be other properties like 'starring' as well. Let me confirm that in Wikidata, \"cast member\" is indeed P161 and whether it's used for actors in films.\n\nYes, checking Wikidata, P161 is used for the cast of a film. So that should be correct.\n\nAnother thought: Do I need to consider `p` and `ps` for qualifiers, or is the direct property sufficient? Since we just want to count if DiCaprio is in the cast, regardless of specific roles, the simple property statement should suffice.\n\nNow, the COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) is needed because each film could have multiple entries or might be returned more than once, but we only want to count each distinct film once.\n\nWait, in the DBpedia query, they used `COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri)` where `?uri` is each film's URI. So in our case, `?item` serves the same purpose, so using `COUNT(DISTINCT ?item)` makes sense.\n\nI also need to ensure that the syntax is correct for Wikidata. In Wikidata, the prefix `wdt:` refers to the statements, and `wd:` refers to the entities themselves. So `wd:Q11424` is the film entity, and `wd:Q38111` is DiCaprio.\n\nLet me double-check if I should use `?item` or another variable name, but in SPARQL, the variable name doesn't matter as long as it's consistent. So `?item` is fine.\n\nSo the final query should select the count of distinct items where they are films and have DiCaprio in the cast. I think this makes sense and should give the correct count.\n\nI don't think I've missed anything. So the SPARQL query should be:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c) WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n  ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q38111 .\n}\n\nYes, that should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo find out how many films Leonardo DiCaprio has starred in using Wikidata, we construct the following SPARQL query. The query identifies each film item that features DiCaprio in its cast and counts the distinct films.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count) \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n        wdt:P161 wd:Q38111 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects each item that is an instance of \"film\" (P31:Q11424) and where Leonardo DiCaprio (Q38111) is listed in the cast (P161). It then counts the distinct films, providing the total number of films he has starred in."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query into a Wikidata one. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is about when Olof Palme was shot. The provided DBpedia query is selecting the death date of Olof Palme. So, the query is using the DBpedia resource for Olof Palme and the ontology property for death date. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource for Olof Palme corresponds to the Wikidata entity Q53713. The deathDate property from DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P570 property. \n\nNow, in Wikidata, we don't use the same URI structure as DBpedia. Instead, we use the entity codes directly. So, instead of using a URI with \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q53713\", we can refer to it as \"wd:Q53713\". Similarly, the property P570 becomes \"wdt:P570\".\n\nIn SPARQL, for Wikidata, the query structure is a bit different. We select variables where certain triples exist. So, the query should select the death date where Olof Palme's Wikidata entity has the death date property.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?date where wd:Q53713 has wdt:P570 as the death date.\n</think>\n\nThe query retrieves the death date of Olof Palme from Wikidata by mapping the DBpedia entities and properties to their corresponding Wikidata equivalents.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities:**\n   - Olof Palme's DBpedia ID maps to Wikidata's `Q53713`.\n   - Death Date property maps from DBpedia's `deathDate` to Wikidata's `P570`.\n\n2. **Construct SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use selection of `?date`.\n   - Apply the triple with subject `wd:Q53713`, predicate `wdt:P570`, and object `?date`.\n\n3. **Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE {\n  wd:Q53713 wdt:P570 ?date .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break down the steps to do this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original DBpedia query. It's selecting movies that star both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton using the property 'starring'. The query joins on the movie URI, which must star both actors.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that 'starring' in DBpedia corresponds to 'P161' in Wikidata. Elizabeth Taylor is mapped to 'Q34851' and Richard Burton to 'Q151973'.\n\nSo, I need to construct a Wikidata query that finds items (movies) where both P161 entities are Taylor and Burton. I'll use the same structure: select distinct items where each item has both starring roles.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax uses 'wd' for entities and 'ps' for properties. So, I'll use 'wd:Q34851' for Taylor and 'wd:Q151973' for Burton. The property will be 'ps:P161'.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will select distinct ?item where ?item has (ps:P161 ?actor1) and ?actor1 is both Taylor and Burton. I'll use two 'VALUES' clauses for the actors.\n\nI think that's all.

The relation is 'starring'.\n2. **Map to Wikidata**: \n   - 'starring' in DBpedia maps to 'P161' in Wikidata.\n   - Elizabeth Taylor maps to 'Q34851' and Richard Burton to 'Q151973'.\n3. **Construct the Query**: We select distinct items where each item has both actors as values for 'P161'.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item p:P161 ?actor1 .\n  ?actor1 ps:P161 wd:Q34851 .\n  ?item p:P161 ?actor2 .\n  ?actor2 ps:P161 wd:Q151973 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves items (movies) in Wikidata where both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are listed under the 'starring' property."

They've provided some mappings from DBpedia to Wikidata, so that should help translate the query.\n\nFirst, I see that the original DBpedia query is selecting the developer of Minecraft. The entity for Minecraft in DBpedia is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minecraft, and the property is dbpedia-ontology:developer. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, Minecraft in DBpedia corresponds to Q49740 in Wikidata. The developer property in DBpedia maps to P178 in Wikidata, which is the \"developer\" property there. \n\nNow, in Wikidata, entities are referenced with QIDs like Q49740, and properties with PIDs like P178. So the query structure in Wikidata would be similar but using these identifiers.\n\nI remember that in Wikidata SPARQL, you typically use the wd: prefix for entities and p: for properties, followed by ps: to specify the statement. So for the developer, it would be something like p:P178 followed by ps:P178.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct items where Minecraft (Q49740) has the developer property. I'll write the WHERE clause to reflect that structure. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. I should make sure to format it properly and check if there's any validation needed, but I'm pretty confident this will work.\n</think>\n\nTo adapt the SPARQL query for Wikidata, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - Entity: Minecraft (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minecraft`)\n   - Relation: developer (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/developer`)\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata:**\n   - Minecraft in DBpedia maps to Q49740 in Wikidata.\n   - Developer in DBpedia maps to P178 in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata entity and property IDs.\n   - Apply the correct syntax for Wikidata SPARQL.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE \n{\n  wd:Q49740 p:P178 ?statement .\n  ?statement ps:P178 ?item .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the distinct items associated with the developer property (P178) for Minecraft (Q49740) in Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to help the user construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided DBpedia query and mappings. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking for the label under which Elvis recorded his first album. The DBpedia SPARQL query is retrieving the record label of Elvis's earliest album by release date. The query uses several prefixes and selects the recordLabel where the artist is Elvis Presley, ordering by release date and limiting to the first result.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I can see how each part of the DBpedia query translates to Wikidata. The main entities and relations are:\n\n- Album in DBpedia maps to Q482994 in Wikidata.\n- Artist maps to P175.\n- Elvis Presley maps to Q303.\n- ReleaseDate maps to P577.\n- RecordLabel maps to P264.\n\nI should now reconstruct the query using Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, properties are prefixed with 'wd:' and entities with 'wdt:' for data types. Also, the 'rdf:type' in DBpedia translates to 'wdt:P31' in Wikidata for 'instance of'.\n\nSo, starting with the base pattern, I'll structure the query to select the record label. I'll define variables for the Elvis entity, the album, release date, and record label. Using 'wdt:P31' for the album type, 'wdt:P175' for the artist being Elvis, 'wdt:P577' for release date, and 'wdt:P264' for the record label.\n\nI need to order the results by release date, so I'll include 'ORDER BY ASC(?releaseDate)'. Since we only need the first album, I'll apply 'LIMIT 1'.\n\nIt's important to ensure all variables are correctly named and that the query follows Wikidata's query structure. I should avoid any syntax errors, like correct use of semicolons and ensuring all prefixes are properly declared.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should effectively mirror the DBpedia query but using the correct Wikidata properties and prefixes. I'll make sure to test the query structure to confirm it logically retrieves the desired information without errors.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we'll map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the 'er2' mappings:\n\n1. **Album (dbo:Album)** -> **Q482994**\n2. **Artist (dbo:artist)** -> **P175**\n3. **Elvis Presley (res:Elvis_Presley)** -> **Q303**\n4. **Release Date (dbo:releaseDate)** -> **P577**\n5. **Record Label (dbo:recordLabel)** -> **P264**\n\nThe SPARQL query pattern is to retrieve the record label of Elvis Presley's first album based on the earliest release date.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?recordLabel\nWHERE\n{\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q482994;\n     wdt:P175 wd:Q303;\n     wdt:P577 ?releaseDate;\n     wdt:P264 ?recordLabel.\n  \n  ORDER BY ASC(?releaseDate)\n  LIMIT 1\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the record label of Elvis Presley's first album by release date using Wikidata's syntax and properties."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so the user is asking about the runtime of Toy Story. They provided some context with a SPARQL query for DBpedia and want the equivalent for Wikidata. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the original query. It's selecting the runtime of Toy Story using DBpedia's ontology. The query uses 'dbo:runtime' from the DBpedia ontology and the resource 'res:Toy_Story'. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that Toy Story in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q171048, and the runtime property maps to P2047. So, the main task is to translate the DBpedia query structure into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nIn DBpedia, it's using dbo:runtime, which in Wikidata is P2047. Also, DBpedia uses PREFIX res for resources, while Wikidata typically uses a default prefix without needing to declare it, so I'll use 'wd:' for Wikidata resources and 'p:' for properties.\n\nThe structure should be similar: select the runtime where Toy Story has the runtime property. So, the subject is wd:Q171048, the predicate is p:P2047, and the object is the runtime variable.\n\nI should construct the query using Wikidata's syntax. I'll start with the prefix for schema, but sometimes it's not needed. Then, the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause linking the subject, predicate, and variable.\n\nI also need to ensure that the variable is correctly named and that there are no syntax errors. Since Wikidata sometimes doesn't require prefixes for certain namespaces, I'll check that. But usually, 'wd:' is for entities and 'p:' for properties. \n\nWait, does the runtime property in Wikidata require a qualifier or is it a direct property? I think P2047 is for duration, so it should work directly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the query should select ?runtime where Toy Story's P2047 is ?runtime. \n\nI think that's it. Now, I'll write the actual query with the correct prefixes and structure.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first map the DBpedia entities and relations to their corresponding Wikidata entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings. \n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:  \n   - `res:Toy_Story` in DBpedia corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q171048` in Wikidata.  \n   - `dbo:runtime` in DBpedia corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2047` in Wikidata.  \n\n2. **Analyze Query Structure**:  \n   The DBpedia query retrieves the runtime of \"Toy Story\" by querying the `dbo:runtime` property for the entity `res:Toy_Story`.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata**:  \n   - Replace `res:Toy_Story` with `wd:Q171048`.  \n   - Replace `dbo:runtime` with `wdt:P2047`.  \n\n4. **Construct SPARQL Query for Wikidata**:  \n   The SPARQL query for Wikidata follows a similar structure but uses Wikidata's syntax and properties.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?runtime \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The user wants this translated to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings provided.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia occupation property maps to Wikidata's P106. The Bandleader resource in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities, Q5280538 and Q806349. I should include both to cover all possibilities. The instrument property in DBpedia maps to P1303 in Wikidata, and the Trumpet resource maps to Q119621 and Q8338. Again, I'll include both.\n\nNow, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, properties are prefixed with 'wd:' and entities with 'wd:'. I'll use the same variable ?uri to select the distinct entities. The occupations are stated using 'wdt:' for direct statements, so I'll set ?uri to have occupation (P106) and instrument (P1303). For each property, I'll add a value filter: for occupation, both Q5280538 and Q806349, and for instrument, both Q119621 and Q8338.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query will Select distinct ?uri where ?uri wdt:P106 is one of the Bandleader entities and wdt:P1303 is one of the Trumpet entities. I'll format this using the correct syntax and filters.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure the query is valid by checking the prefixes and syntax for Wikidata. This should return all entities that are bandleaders and play the trumpet, just like the DBpedia query does.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key entities and relations in the question**  \n- **Entities**: \"Bandleader\", \"Trumpet\"  \n- **Relations**: \"occupation\", \"instrument\"\n\n**Step 2: Map the entities and relations to Wikidata using 'er2'**  \n- **dbo:occupation** \u2192 **wdt:P106**  \n- **dbo:Bandleader** \u2192 **wd:Q5280538**, **wd:Q806349**  \n- **dbo:instrument** \u2192 **wdt:P1303**  \n- **dbo:Trumpet** \u2192 **wd:Q119621**, **wd:Q8338**\n\n**Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata**  \n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538, wd:Q806349 ;\n       wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621, wd:Q8338 .\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Validate the query**  \n- The query selects distinct URIs (`?uri`) that have both the \"occupation\" and \"instrument\" properties.  \n- The occupation is constrained to be either \"Bandleader\" (`wd:Q5280538` or `wd:Q806349`).  \n- The instrument is constrained to be \"Trumpet\" (`wd:Q119621` or `wd:Q8338`).  \n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**  \n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538, wd:Q806349 ;\n       wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621, wd:Q8338 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

In SPARQL, we can represent this as `wd:Q11424`.\n   \n2. **Starring**: DBpedia's `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring` maps to Wikidata's property `P161`, which is `starring` as well.\n\n3. **Julia Roberts**: She's mapped from `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julia_Roberts` to `Q40523`.\n\n4. **Director**: This is mapped from DBpedia's `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director` to Wikidata's `P57`, which is `director`.\n\n5. **Garry Marshall**: Mapped from `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garry_Marshall` to `Q315087`.\n\nNow, constructing the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n- We need to query for items where each item is a film (`wd:Q11424`), has Julia Roberts as a starring actor (`wdt:P161 wd:Q40523`), and Garry Marshall as the director (`wdt:P57 wd:Q315087`).\n\nPutting it together, the query should select distinct items that meet these criteria.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map each DBpedia entity and relation to its corresponding Wikidata entity using the provided ER mappings. \n\nThe result is the following query that fetches films directed by Garry Marshall and starring Julia Roberts:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film \nWHERE \n{ \n  ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q315087 ;\n        wdt:P161 wd:Q40523 ;\n        wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n}\n```\n\nThe final query is encapsulated as:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film WHERE { ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q315087 ; wdt:P161 wd:Q40523 ; wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 . }\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the original query is for DBpedia: it's looking for the birth year of Rachel Stevens. The SPARQL query uses the DBpedia ontology (dbo) and resource (res) prefixes. It selects the distinct ?uri where res:Rachel_Stevens has the dbo:birthYear property with the value ?uri.\n\nNow, the task is to map this to Wikidata. I have the ER2 mappings provided. The first mapping is from DBpedia's Rachel_Stevens to Wikidata's Q241665. The second mapping is from DBpedia's birthYear (dbo:birthYear) to Wikidata's P569 property.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, instead of using res:Rachel_Stevens, I should use the WD item Q241665. Similarly, instead of dbo:birthYear, I'll use wdt:P569, which is the direct property for birth year in Wikidata.\n\nThe structure of the original DBpedia query is SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Rachel_Stevens dbo:birthYear ?uri }. So in Wikidata, it should be similar but using the appropriate prefixes and properties.\n\nIn Wikidata, the prefix for entities is usually wd, and for properties, it's wdt. So, the query becomes selecting ?birthYear where wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?birthYear.\n\nI also need to make sure that I'm using the correct syntax. In Wikidata SPARQL, the query would start with PREFIXes for wd and wdt, but those are often predefined, so I might not need to include them explicitly. However, including them can make the query more readable.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select ?birthYear from the Wikidata graph where Rachel Stevens (Q241665) has the P569 property indicating her birth year.\n\nI should double-check if P569 is indeed the correct property for birth year. From my knowledge, P569 is \"date of birth\" which includes the year, so that's appropriate. If the query should only return the year, maybe I need to extract the year from the date, but the original query returns the year, so this should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the Wikidata SPARQL query would look like selecting ?birthYear where wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?birthYear, and ensuring it's distinct as in the original query.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information:\n\n1. Identify the entities and relations from the DBpedia query.\n2. Map these entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n3. Construct the query using Wikidata prefixes and syntax.\n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n- **DBpedia Entity**: `res:Rachel_Stevens` maps to **Wikidata Entity**: `wd:Q241665`\n- **DBpedia Property**: `dbo:birthYear` maps to **Wikidata Property**: `wdt:P569`\n\nThe structure of the DBpedia query is:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Rachel_Stevens dbo:birthYear ?uri }\n```\n\nThe equivalent Wikidata query becomes:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?birthYear WHERE { wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?birthYear }\n```\n\nEnclosed in the necessary tags:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?birthYear WHERE { wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?birthYear }\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?birthYear WHERE { wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?birthYear }\n```"

Let me break down the steps I should take.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query: It selects ?x where there's a deathCause relation. It orders the results by the count of distinct URIs in descending order and limits the result to one.\n\nNow, I check the entity and relation mappings provided. The DBpedia deathCause property maps to Wikidata's P509. So, in Wikidata, I should use P509 instead of deathCause.\n\nNext, I think about how Wikidata structures its data. In Wikidata, to count the number of times a property is used, I'd use the COUNT function on the subject (which would be the person or item) and possibly the object (the cause of death). \n\nI notice that in the DBpedia query, the ORDER BY is based on COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri). In Wikidata, each item is unique, so using COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) makes sense. \n\nThen, I need to form the SPARQL query. I'll start with SELECT and choose the count and the cause of death. But since the user wants the most frequent cause, they might just need the cause, so maybe I can just select ?cause. However, including the count could be helpful for verification.\n\nI also need to ensure that the query fetches the cause and counts it properly. Using GROUP BY on ?cause will allow me to aggregate the counts per cause. \n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the query to select ?item and ?cause where the death cause (P509) is present. Then, group by ?cause, count the items, order them descending, and limit to the top one.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants just the cause, so in the initial SELECT, I should only have ?cause. But including the count could help in understanding the frequency.\n\nI also recall that Wikidata might require prefixes for namespaces, so including PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> would be appropriate.\n\nSo the final query should group by ?cause, count the number of items, order by count descending, and return the cause with the highest count.\n</think>\n\nThe most frequent cause of death is determined by analyzing the number of occurrences of each cause within the dataset. To achieve this in Wikidata, we map the DBpedia `deathCause` property to Wikidata's `P509` and construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the most frequent cause.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?cause (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P509 ?cause .\n}\nGROUP BY ?cause\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query selects the cause of death that appears most frequently in the dataset by counting distinct items and ordering the results in descending order."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how high the Yokohama Marine Tower is by using the Wikidata knowledge graph instead of DBpedia. Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the original DBpedia SPARQL query provided. It uses the \"dbo:height\" property from DBpedia to get the height of the \"Yokohama_Marine_Tower\". The query is straightforward\u2014SELECT DISTINCT the height value where the Marine Tower has the height property.\n\nNow, I need to convert this into a Wikidata query. From the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource for \"Yokohama_Marine_Tower\" maps to the Wikidata entity \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1207989\". Similarly, the DBpedia property \"dbo:height\" corresponds to Wikidata's \"P2048\" which is \"height\".\n\nSo, in Wikidata, entities are referred to by their Q numbers, and properties by their P numbers. The structure of a Wikidata SPARQL query uses these prefixes. The query should select the height value where Q1207989 has the property P2048.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, you can either use the prefix wd: to denote entities and p: for properties. However, the actual property is often split into two parts: p:P2048 and ps:P2048 for the main statement and any qualifiers. But since the question is just about the height, I think using p:P2048 would be sufficient.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should be SELECT DISTINCT ?height WHERE { wd:Q1207989 p:P2048 ?height }. This should return the height of the Yokohama Marine Tower from Wikidata.\n\nI should also consider if there are any additional constraints or if the height might be in a certain unit. But since the original query didn't specify, I'll keep it simple and just fetch the height without any filters.\n\nTo make sure, I'll check if the query syntax is correct. In Wikidata, using the p: and ps: prefixes correctly is important. Also, ensuring that the variable names are correctly placed. So, yes, SELECT DISTINCT ?height WHERE { wd:Q1207989 p:P2048 ?height } looks correct.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were mapping the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents using the ER2 mappings, understanding the structure of the Wikidata query, and constructing it accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height of the Yokohama Marine Tower using Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts and construct the appropriate SPARQL query.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?height \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1207989 wdt:P2048 ?height\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query into a Wikidata one. Let me start by understanding what the original query is doing.\n\nThe original query is asking for the highest mountain in Italy. It uses DBpedia's ontology and resources. The query selects a URI where the URI is of type dbo:Mountain, located in res:Italy, and has an elevation number. It then orders these by the elevation in descending order and limits the result to one, which would be the highest mountain.\n\nNow, I need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. Let me break this down:\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations:**\n   - The main entity is \"Mountain,\" which is represented as dbo:Mountain in DBpedia. In ER2, this maps to Wikidata's Q8502.\n   - The relation \"locatedInArea\" in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P131.\n   - The resource \"Italy\" in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q38.\n   - The property \"elevation\" in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P2044.\n\n2. **Understand the Query Structure:**\n   The DBpedia query is selecting mountains located in Italy and retrieving their elevations. It's sorted by elevation in descending order to find the highest one.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   In Wikidata, entities are referred to by their Q numbers, like Q8502 for Mountain, and properties are referred to by their P numbers, like P131 for located in.\n\n4. **Constructing the SPARQL Query:**\n   SPARQL syntax for Wikidata will use the wd: prefix for entities and p: or ps:/pq: for properties. For example, the type would be wdt:P31 (instance of) linking to wd:Q8502 (Mountain). The located in would be wdt:P131 linking to wd:Q38 (Italy). Elevation is wdt:P2044.\n\n   Also, note that in Wikidata, to get the elevation, it's a qualifier, so we might need to use `ps:P2044` and `pq:P2044` for the elevation value.\n\n5. **Ordering and Limiting:**\n   We want to order by the elevation in descending order and limit to one result.\n\n6. **Potential Issues:**\n   I'm a bit unsure about using `ORDER BY DESC(wd:P2044)` or if I need to alias it correctly. Maybe I should use a variable for elevation and order by that variable.\n\n   Also, in the original query, `?num` is used for elevation. I'll need to make sure that variable is properly captured in the Wikidata query.\n\n7. **Putting It All Together:**\n   Let me draft the query step by step.\n\n   - SELECT the mountain's URI ?uri.\n   - Mountain is URI of type wdt:P31 wd:Q8502.\n   - Located in Italy: wdt:P131 wd:Q38.\n   - Elevation: wdt:P2044 ?elevation.\n   - Order by ?elevation descending.\n   - Limit to one result.\n\n   Now, writing this in SPARQL, using proper prefixes and syntax.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step construction of the Wikidata SPARQL query based on the original DBpedia query:\n\n1. **Prefixes:** Use the standard prefixes for Wikidata, which are `wd:` for entities and `p:` or `ps:`/`pq:` for properties.\n\n2. **SELECT:** Retrieve the URI of the mountain.\n\n3. **WHERE:** Define the conditions.\n   - The URI is an instance of Mountain (P31).\n   - The mountain is located in Italy (P131).\n   - Retrieve the elevation value (P2044).\n\n4. **ORDER BY:** Sort the results by elevation in descending order.\n\n5. **LIMIT:** Return only the highest mountain.\n\nCombining these, the query becomes:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n       wdt:P131 wd:Q38 ;\n       wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n  \n  } ORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\n  LIMIT 1\n```\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n     wdt:P131 wd:Q38 ;\n     wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out who Albert Einstein's doctoral supervisor was. I've been given a similar query that works for DBpedia, so I should start by analyzing that.\n\nThe DBpedia query uses the dbo:doctoralAdvisor property. I remember that in Wikidata, properties are usually denoted with 'P' numbers. Looking at the ER2 mappings, I see that dbpedia:doctoralAdvisor corresponds to wikidata:P184. So, I'll need to use P184 in the Wikidata query.\n\nNext, the entity for Albert Einstein in DBpedia is res:Albert_Einstein. The ER2 mappings show that his Wikidata ID is Q937. So, in the Wikidata query, I should use wd:Q937 instead.\n\nNow, I remember that in SPARQL for Wikidata, we often use the prefix wdt: for properties. So, instead of dbo:doctoralAdvisor, I should use wdt:P184. The variable for the doctoral supervisor is ?uri in the DBpedia query, so I'll keep that consistent.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure of the query should select the variable where Einstein (wd:Q937) has the property wdt:P184 with that variable. I also need to make sure to use the correct prefixes for Wikidata, which are usually wd: and wdt:.\n\nLet me double-check if P184 is indeed the correct property. Yes, P184 corresponds to 'doctoral advisor' in Wikidata, so that's right. I also need to ensure that the variable is correctly placed and that the query is properly formatted.\n\nSo, the final query should select distinct ?uri where wd:Q937 is connected via wdt:P184 to ?uri. I'll make sure to include the necessary prefixes for wd and wdt to avoid any errors.\n\nI think that's it. Time to put it all together into the SPARQL query.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we start by identifying the key entities and relations from the DBpedia query and map them to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings. Here's how each component is mapped:\n\n1. **Entity**: `res:Albert_Einstein` in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q937` in Wikidata.\n2. **Relation**: `dbo:doctoralAdvisor` in DBpedia maps to `wdt:P184` in Wikidata.\n\nThe structure of the query remains consistent, but the syntax is adjusted to fit Wikidata's requirements.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q937 wdt:P184 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

First, the original question is asking about Donald Trump's main business, and we have a DBpedia SPARQL query that retrieves the owner where Donald Trump is the owner. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, the DBpedia ontology 'owner' corresponds to Wikidata's P127. Also, Donald Trump in DBpedia is mapped to Q22686 in Wikidata. \n\nSo, the original query is SELECT ?owner WHERE { ?owner dbo:owner dbr:Donald_Trump }. In Wikidata, since we're looking for entities owned by Trump, we need to structure it as Trump being the owner. Therefore, the predicate should be P127, and the subject will be Trump's Wikidata ID.\n\nPutting it all together, the Wikidata query will select the owners where Donald Trump (Q22686) is the owner. The variable here is ?business. So the query becomes SELECT ?business WHERE { wd:Q22686 p:P127 ?business }.\n\nI just need to make sure the syntax is correct, using 'wd' for entities and 'p' for properties in Wikidata.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information. The user provided a context where the original query was for DBpedia, and now I need to map that to Wikidata. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking who Tom Cruise has been married to. The DBpedia SPARQL query is SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise> }. So, it's looking for all URIs where the spouse is Tom Cruise.\n\nThe ER2 mappings provided show that the DBpedia spouse property (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse) maps to Wikidata's P26 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P26), and Tom Cruise in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise) maps to Wikidata's Q37079 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079).\n\nNow, I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, the query syntax is slightly different. Instead of using angle brackets for prefixes, we use prefix declarations. So, the DBpedia Ontology 'spouse' becomes Wikidata's 'p' followed by the P26, but in SPARQL, we need to use the prefix 'wd' for Wikidata entities and 'p' for properties.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in SPARQL for Wikidata, the properties are referred to using 'wdt:' for data properties and 'wpdt:' for Property Data Types. So, for P26, it's wdt:P26. Similarly, Q37079 is wd:Q37079.\n\nSo, the structure of the query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P26 wd:Q37079\n}\n\nThis would select all items (people) where their spouse is Tom Cruise. I should ensure that the prefixes are correctly declared, but in many cases, the default prefixes are already understood, so implicit use is okay.\n\nI also need to make sure that the query is correct. Since the original query was about finding spouses OF Tom Cruise, in Wikidata, the property P26 is \"spouse\" and the direction matters. In Wikidata, the spouse relationship is from the subject to their spouse, so if we have ?item wdt:P26 wd:Q37079, it's saying that ?item's spouse is Tom Cruise, which would mean Tom Cruise is the spouse of ?item. But that's not what we want. Wait, actually, no. The original query in DBpedia is ?uri <dbpedia:spouse> <dbpedia:Tom_Cruise>, which means that ?uri has Tom Cruise as their spouse. So that's correct because the spouse is the object.\n\nWait, in SPARQL, the order is subject-predicate-object. So in DBpedia, the query is { ?uri dbpedia:spouse dbpedia:Tom_Cruise }, so ?uri is the subject, dbpedia:spouse is the predicate, and dbpedia:Tom_Cruise is the object. Therefore, it's selecting all ?uri where their spouse is Tom Cruise.\n\nIn Wikidata, P26 also represents spouse, but the direction is the same. So, using { ?item wdt:P26 wd:Q37079 } would give us all ?item that have Tom Cruise as their spouse, meaning Tom Cruise is married to them. But we want to ask who has been married to Tom Cruise, which is the same as whose spouse is Tom Cruise. So, the structure is correct.\n\nBut wait, actually, in Wikidata, P26 is used in both directions. So if someone is married to Tom Cruise, it's not necessarily that they have Tom Cruise as their spouse. It's more like Tom Cruise is the subject with P26 pointing to the spouse. Therefore, maybe the query should be { wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item }, which would find all ?item such that Tom Cruise's spouse is ?item. That makes more sense because the question is asking for the spouses of Tom Cruise.\n\nSo correcting that, the query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item\n}\n\nThis way, we're directly selecting the spouses of Tom Cruise, which is what the original question is asking.\n\nI think I initially had the subject and object reversed. It's important to get the direction right in the triple. So in the DBpedia query, the subject is the spouse, and the object is Tom Cruise. So in Wikidata, to get Tom Cruise's spouses, the subject should be Tom Cruise, the predicate is P26, and the object is the spouse.\n\nTherefore, the correct query should be as above, with Tom Cruise as the subject.\n</think>\n\nTo determine who Tom Cruise has been married to, we need to adjust the original SPARQL query for Wikidata, ensuring the correct subject-predicate-object structure.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entity and Relation Mappings:**\n   - Tom Cruise in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q37079` in Wikidata.\n   - The relation `spouse` (DBpedia) maps to `P26` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Understand Query Structure:**\n   - The original DBpedia query finds entities where the spouse is Tom Cruise. In Wikidata, we need to structure the query to find spouses of Tom Cruise.\n\n3. **Correct Predicate Direction:**\n   - In Wikidata, `P26` (spouse) should have Tom Cruise as the subject to correctly retrieve his spouses.\n\n**SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all items (`?item`) such that Tom Cruise (`wd:Q37079`) is their spouse.\n\n</sparql>"

Let me break down the steps as I understand them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original question and the existing SPARQL query from DBpedia. The question is asking about the population of Eurasia. The provided DBpedia SPARQL query uses the prefix dbo for the ontology and res for the resource. It selects the distinct population where Eurasia has the property populationTotal.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings, I see that DBpedia's Eurasia resource (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurasia) maps to Wikidata's Q5401. Additionally, the populationTotal property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P1082. So, I need to replace the DBpedia prefixes and URIs with the corresponding Wikidata ones.\n\nWikidata typically uses the prefix wdt for properties and wd for entities. So, the resource Eurasia in Wikidata would be wd:Q5401, and the population property would be wdt:P1082.\n\nPutting this together, the structure of the SPARQL query should remain the same. I'll select the population where Eurasia (wd:Q5401) has the populationTotal (wdt:P1082) property.\n\nI should ensure that the query uses the correct prefixes and syntax for Wikidata. There's no need for additional prefixes since the standard ones are usually predefined.\n\nLet me think if there's any potential issue. Maybe checking if P1082 covers the total population as intended. From what I know, P1082 in Wikidata is indeed used for population, so that seems correct. Also, ensuring that I'm asking for the population of Eurasia, which is a continent, and not any other entity. Since the mapping is direct, I don't think there's a mix-up.\n\nI'll construct the query accordingly, making sure it's clean and follows the correct syntax.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed by mapping the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents. Using the provided ER2 mappings, we replace the resources and properties accordingly. The query structure remains consistent, selecting the population of Eurasia using the appropriate Wikidata prefixes.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?population \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q5401 wdt:P1082 ?population.\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original DBpedia query is selecting the author of \"The Interpretation of Dreams.\" It uses the dbo:author property. I need to translate this into Wikidata's terms.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" in DBpedia is linked to Wikidata's Q726382. Also, the author property in DBpedia (dbo:author) maps to Wikidata's P50. So, I'll replace the DBpedia resources with their Wikidata counterparts.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax starts with the PREFIX wd: and p: for properties. The query structure is similar, but I need to use the correct Wikidata entities. So instead of dbr:The_Interpretation_of_Dreams, I'll use wd:Q726382. The property dbo:author becomes p:P50, and the variable ?Author remains the same.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should select the author where the work is Q726382 and the property is P50. I think that's it. I don't see any need for additional triples or filters since the structure is straightforward.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, sometimes the author property is used differently, but I think P50 is correct for authors. Also, ensuring that the triple is correctly formed with the predicate in the middle. Yes, that's right. So the final query should be as I constructed.\n</think>\n\nTo find the author of \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" in Wikidata, we can construct a SPARQL query using the mappings provided.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - The entity is \"The Interpretation of Dreams.\"\n   - The relation is \"author.\"\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" maps to `wd:Q726382`.\n   - \"author\" in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's `p:P50`.\n\n3. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd:` for entities and `p:` for properties.\n   - Select the author where the work is `wd:Q726382` and the property is `p:P50`.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT ?Author WHERE {\n  wd:Q726382 p:P50 ?Author\n}\n</sparql>\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT ?Author WHERE {\n  wd:Q726382 p:P50 ?Author\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user wants a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out when John Adams was born. \n\nFirst, the original query uses DBpedia. It selects the birthDate of John Adams using the dbo namespace. So, the key entities here are John Adams and his birth date.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, John Adams in DBpedia corresponds to Q11806 in Wikidata. The birthDate property in DBpedia is mapped to P569 in Wikidata. So, I need to switch these in the new query.\n\nIn Wikidata, the query structure is a bit different. Instead of using prefixes like dbo, I'll use the full URIs or the short prefixes like wdt for properties. So, I'll use wdt:P569 for birth date.\n\nI also need to make sure the prefixes are correctly declared. So, I'll include PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nPutting it all together, the new query should select the birth date from the Wikidata entity Q11806 using the P569 property. I'll make sure to use DISTINCT to get a single result and ensure the format is correct.\n\nFinally, I'll double-check the syntax to make sure there are no errors. Once everything looks good, the query should correctly fetch John Adams' birth date from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:  \n   - The entity is \"John Adams,\" identified by `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Adams` in DBpedia.  \n   - The relation is \"birthDate,\" identified by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthDate` in DBpedia.\n\n2. **Map Entities and Relations to Wikidata**:  \n   - Using the provided ER2 mappings:  \n     - `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Adams` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11806`.  \n     - `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthDate` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P569`.\n\n3. **Understand the Query Pattern**:  \n   - The DBpedia query retrieves the birth date (`dbo:birthDate`) of \"John Adams.\"\n\n4. **Find Equivalent Properties in Wikidata**:  \n   - In Wikidata, the equivalent property for \"birth date\" is `P569`.\n\n5. **Construct the SPARQL Query for Wikidata**:  \n   - Use the Wikidata entity `Q11806` for John Adams.  \n   - Use the property `P569` for birth date.  \n   - Maintain the same query structure but adapt it to Wikidata's syntax.\n\n6. **Validate the Query**:  \n   - Ensure all entities, relationships, and logic align with Wikidata's data model.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q11806 wdt:P569 ?date\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to convert a SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the original query is about finding the total population of the European Union using DBpedia. The query is:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT ?europop \nWHERE { \n  dbr:European_Union dbo:populationTotal ?europop \n}\n\nNow, the task is to create an equivalent query for Wikidata. I remember that in Wikidata, entities and properties have different identifiers compared to DBpedia. Looking at the ER2 mappings provided:\n\n- The European Union in DBpedia is mapped to Q458 in Wikidata.\n- The populationTotal property (dbo:populationTotal) is mapped to P1082 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to adjust the prefixes and the resource identifiers accordingly. In Wikidata, the common prefix is wd:, and for properties, it's usually wdt:. So, instead of dbo:populationTotal, I'll use wdt:P1082.\n\nPutting it all together, the European Union is identified as wd:Q458, and the population property is wdt:P1082. The variable ?europop remains the same since it's just a variable name.\n\nI should also ensure that the SPARQL syntax is correct for Wikidata. Wikidata often uses the wd: prefix for entities and wdt: for properties in the triple store. So, the WHERE clause would have wd:Q458 wdt:P1082 ?europop.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other considerations. Sometimes, Wikidata might have additional constraints or different naming conventions, but in this case, the properties seem to map directly. Also, I don't think any additional triples or filters are needed beyond what's in the original query.\n\nSo, the final query should select ?europop where the European Union entity has the populationTotal property set to that variable.\n</think>\n\nTo find the total population of the European Union from Wikidata, we need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents. Here's how it's done:\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Properties**: The entity \"European_Union\" in DBpedia is mapped to Q458 in Wikidata. The property \"populationTotal\" (dbo:populationTotal) is mapped to P1082 in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Adjust Prefixes**: In Wikidata, entities are referenced with `wd:` and properties with `wdt:`. So, we use `wd:Q458` for the entity and `wdt:P1082` for the property.\n\n3. **Construct the Query**: The variable `?europop` is used to capture the population value. The query selects this variable where the European Union entity has the populationTotal property.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?europop WHERE {\n  wd:Q458 wdt:P1082 ?europop\n}\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the given DBpedia query and mappings.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the original DBpedia SPARQL query. The query is selecting distinct URIs where each URI is of type Rocket and has a launch site located at Baikonur Cosmodrome. The key parts are:\n- `?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Rocket>`: This defines the type of entities we're interested in, which are rockets.\n- `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/launchSite> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baikonur_Cosmodrome>`: This specifies that the launch site of these rockets is Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nNext, I'll use the provided ER2 mappings to translate these parts from DBpedia to Wikidata. From the mappings, the Rocket type maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41291`, the launchSite property maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P448`, and Baikonur Cosmodrome maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q177477`.\n\nNow, I'll construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, we use `wd:` for entities and `p:` for properties, followed by `ps:` for the property statements. So:\n- The type `Rocket` becomes `wd:Q41291`.\n- The property `launchSite` becomes `p:P448` and the value `Baikonur_Cosmodrome` becomes `wd:Q177477`.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select all distinct items where the item is an instance of Rocket and has the launch site property set to Baikonur Cosmodrome. In Wikidata syntax, this translates to using `instance of` for type and the property with its value.\n\nI also need to ensure the correct use of Wikidata's syntax, which often involves `ps:` for property statements. So, the final query uses `ps,p?></http://www.wikidata.org/prop/P448>` to represent the launch site property.\n\nFinally, I'll validate the query to make sure all entities, properties, and syntax are correctly aligned with Wikidata's structure. This includes checking the prefixes and ensuring that the logic correctly mirrors the original DBpedia query.\n</think>\n\nFor the given question, we need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that identifies rockets launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Here's how we can build this query:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key entities and relations**\n- **Entity 1:** Rocket (DBpedia ontology URI: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Rocket` \u2192 Wikidata URI: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41291`)\n- **Relation:** launch site (DBpedia ontology URI: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/launchSite` \u2192 Wikidata URI: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P448`)\n- **Entity 2:** Baikonur Cosmodrome (DBpedia resource URI: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baikonur_Cosmodrome` \u2192 Wikidata URI: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q177477`)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the query pattern in the DBpedia SPARQL query**\nThe query pattern is:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Rocket> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/launchSite> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baikonur_Cosmodrome> }\n```\nThis query retrieves all URIs of entities that are of type Rocket and have their launch site set to Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\n**Step 3: Translate the query into Wikidata equivalents**\nUsing the mappings provided:\n- Rocket (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Rocket` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q41291`)\n- launch site (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/launchSite` \u2192 Wikidata: `P448`)\n- Baikonur Cosmodrome (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baikonur_Cosmodrome` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q177477`)\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Wikidata SPARQL query**\nWe need to select all distinct items in Wikidata where:\n- The item is an instance of Rocket (`wd:Q41291`).\n- The item has the launch site property (`wdt:P448`) set to Baikonur Cosmodrome (`wd:Q177477`).\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL syntax, this query would be:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q41291.\n    ?item wdt:P448 wd:Q177477.\n}\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the query components:\n- `SELECT DISTINCT ?item`: Retrieves distinct items that match the criteria.\n- `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q41291.`: Specifies that the item must be an instance of Rocket.\n- `?item wdt:P448 wd:Q177477.`: Specifies that the item must have Baikonur Cosmodrome as its launch site.\n\n**Step 5: Validate the query**\n- Ensure that the properties and entities are correctly mapped between DBpedia and Wikidata.\n- Verify that the query follows Wikidata's SPARQL syntax and namespace conventions (e.g., `wdt:` for properties and `wd:` for entities).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q41291.\n    ?item wdt:P448 wd:Q177477.\n}\n```\n\nThis query correctly retrieves all items in Wikidata that represent rockets launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The logical structure mirrors the original DBpedia query, and all entities and relationships have been accurately mapped using the provided ER2 mappings."

The goal is to find all islands that belong to Japan. \n\nFirst, I look at the original SPARQL query for DBpedia. It's selecting distinct URIs where each URI is of type Island and is associated with the country Japan. So, in DBpedia, the query uses the ontology terms 'Island' and 'country', and the resource 'Japan'.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia terms to their corresponding Wikidata entities using the ER2 mappings provided. I see that the DBpedia 'Island' is mapped to Wikidata's Q23442. The 'country' property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P17. Finally, 'Japan' is mapped to Q17 in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I think about how Wikidata structures its data. In Wikidata, to find all islands, I'd need to query for items that are instances of 'island' (Q23442) and have the 'country' (P17) property set to Japan (Q17). \n\nSo, I structure the SPARQL query accordingly. I use the prefix 'wd' for Wikidata entities and 'wds' for the snippets. I start with a SELECT DISTINCT statement to get the unique items. Each item should have the property P31 (instance of) set to Q23442 (island) and P17 (country) set to Q17 (Japan).\n\nI write the WHERE clause to include these two conditions. I make sure to use the correct syntax, with 'a' for 'rdf:type' and the appropriate prefixes. Finally, I format the query properly, ensuring that all the entities and properties are correctly referenced from Wikidata.\n\nI double-check to make sure the query is valid by ensuring that all the entities and relations align correctly with Wikidata's structure. This makes me confident that the query will return the desired results when executed.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and relations from the DBpedia query to their equivalents in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Island` \u2192 **Mapped to**: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23442` (Wikidata ID for \"island\").\n   - **Relation**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country` \u2192 **Mapped to**: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17` (Wikidata property for \"country\").\n   - **Entity**: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan` \u2192 **Mapped to**: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17` (Wikidata ID for \"Japan\").\n\n2. **Equivalent Properties in Wikidata**:\n   - Use the Wikidata properties and entities identified above to create the equivalent SPARQL query.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Select distinct items (`?item`) that are islands (`wd:Q23442`).\n   - Ensure these items are associated with the country Japan (`wd:Q17`).\n\n4. **Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata**:\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q23442.\n    ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q17.\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct items in Wikidata that are classified as islands (`Q23442`) and are associated with Japan (`Q17`)."

Let me go through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the original query is selecting the developer of World of Warcraft from DBpedia. The query uses the dbo:developer property. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that World of Warcraft in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q131007. The developer property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P178, which is \"developer\" as well. \n\nSo, in Wikidata, instead of using dbo:developer, I should use wdt:P178. The resource for World of Warcraft is Q131007. \n\nI remember that in Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:' in SPARQL, but I think that's optional. The general pattern is to use wd: followed by the entity ID. \n\nPutting this together, the query should select the developer where the subject is wd:Q131007 and the predicate is wdt:P178. \n\nWait, do I need to use a prefix like 'wd:' or can I just use the full URL? Probably, using wd:Q131007 is sufficient since the query will be run on Wikidata. \n\nSo the SELECT statement will ask for the ?developer variable. \n\nI think the structure should be:\n\nSELECT ?developer WHERE {\n  wd:Q131007 wdt:P178 ?developer\n}\n\nThat should fetch all developers associated with World of Warcraft in Wikidata. \n\nLet me double-check if I'm using the correct property. Yes, P178 is the correct one for developer in Wikidata. \n\nI also need to make sure the syntax is correct. 'wdt:' is used for data properties, so that's right. \n\nThis should work to get the developers.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we use the mapped entities and properties.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help the user write a SPARQL query for Wikidata that's equivalent to the DBpedia query they provided. The original query is counting distinct companies in the advertising industry. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the DBpedia query is doing. It's selecting the count of distinct URIs where the URI is a company, and either the industry is exactly Advertising, or the industry has a name that includes \"advertising\" case-insensitively.\n\nNow, I have to map the DBpedia entities to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings. From the ER2, I can see that:\n\n- The company in DBpedia is mapped to Q4830453 in Wikidata.\n- The industry property in DBpedia is P452 in Wikidata.\n- Advertising in DBpedia is mapped to Q854995, Q37038, or Q1286627 in Wikidata.\n\nWait, but how exactly does the industry property work in Wikidata? In SPARQL, we usually use the form ?s p:P452 [ ps:P452 ?industry ; ... ]. So I think the structure is that the main subject has a property P452, which is a statement, and that statement has a value which is the industry.\n\nIn the original DBpedia query, the industry is either exactly Advertising or has a name containing \"advertising\". But in Wikidata, perhaps we can handle this by first checking if the industry is one of those specific Q nodes.\n\nSo, in the SPARQL query, I need to count all distinct items where they are a company (Q4830453). They should have the industry property, and that industry should be either Q854995, Q37038, or Q1286627.\n\nSo putting it all together, the query would structure like:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?company) AS ?c) WHERE {\n  ?company wdt:P31/Q4830453.\n  ?company wdt:P452 ?industry.\n  VALUES ?industry { Q854995 Q37038 Q1286627 }\n}\n\nI think this should work. It counts each company once, checks that they are companies, and have their industry set to one of the advertising-related items.\n\nI should also make sure that the syntax is correct for Wikidata. Using wdt:P31 for the company type, P452 for industry, and then using VALUES for the industry options seems right. This way, it's efficient and clear.\n\nI don't think a UNION is needed here since we're just checking if the industry is one of the three options, so VALUES should suffice. Also, using DISTINCT in the COUNT is important to avoid counting duplicates.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident this query should return the correct count of companies in the advertising industry according to Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nThe equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, based on the mappings and structure, would be as follows:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?company) AS ?c)\nWHERE \n{\n  ?company wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453 ;\n           wdt:P452 ?industry .\n  VALUES ?industry { wd:Q854995 wd:Q37038 wd:Q1286627 }\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively counts the distinct companies in the advertising industry using the mapped entities and properties."

Let me start by breaking down the original query to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe original query is using DBpedia's ontology and resources. It's selecting the university that Angela Merkel attended. The query uses the dbo:almaMater property. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that Angela Merkel in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q567, and the dbo:almaMater is mapped to Wikidata's P69. So, I'll need to replace these in the query. \n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using prefixes like dbo: and res:, I'll use the wd: and p: prefixes. So, res:Angela_Merkel becomes wd:Q567, and dbo:almaMater becomes p:P69. \n\nI also need to structure the WHERE clause correctly. In Wikidata, properties are often used with the p: and ps: prefixes, where p: is for the property and ps: is for the property statement. But for simpler queries, sometimes just using p: is sufficient.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll rewrite the query to select the university where Angela Merkel's alma mater is that university. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes and adjust the syntax to fit Wikidata's standards.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we identify the entities and map them using ER2. Angela Merkel is Q567 and almaMater is P69 in Wikidata. The query structure remains similar, replacing DBpedia prefixes with Wikidata's.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?university \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?university.\n}\n```"

The starring property maps to P161, which is \"cast member.\" Neil Patrick Harris's DBpedia resource maps to Q485310 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, the class for TV shows is Q15416, and P161 represents the starring relationship.

The where clause first binds Neil Patrick Harris to ?person for clarity. Then, I look for items where the item is a TV show (wd:Q15416), and has a cast member (p:P161) that is ?person.\n\nI include the specific item for Neil Patrick Harris using [ wdt:P161 <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q485310> ].\n\nI add a SERVICE clause with around to get the labels. \n\nFinally, I ensure the query is correctly formatted and runs in Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find all movies starring Tom Cruise, similar to the given DBpedia query. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the original DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the URI is a type of Film and stars Tom Cruise. The query uses the DBpedia ontology terms for Film and starring.\n\nNext, I refer to the ER2 mappings provided. The key here is to map each part of the DBpedia query to Wikidata. \n\n1. **Mapping the Film entity**: In DBpedia, it's `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film`. The ER2 shows that this maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424`, which is \"film\" in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Mapping the starring relation**: The DBpedia property `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring` maps to Wikidata's `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161`, which is \"cast member\" or \"starring\".\n\n3. **Mapping Tom Cruise**: His DBpedia ID `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079` in Wikidata.\n\nNow, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, a query typically starts with `PREFIX` to abbreviate namespaces, though it's optional. The main structure is to select items where the item is a film and has Tom Cruise as a cast member.\n\nSo, the query should:\n- Select distinct items (?item).\n- Use `wd:` prefix for Wikidata entities.\n- Check that the item is an instance of Film (Q11424).\n- Check that the item has Tom Cruise (Q37079) as a cast member (P161).\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look something like selecting all items that are films and where Tom Cruise is in the cast.\n\nI should also make sure to validate that the properties and entities exist in Wikidata. From what I know, P161 is indeed the correct property for cast members, and Q11424 corresponds to film. Tom Cruise's Q37079 is accurate.\n\nSo, the final SPARQL query would use these mappings in the correct syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and relations from DBpedia to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings. Here's how the query is built:\n\n1. **Entities and Relations Mapping**:\n   - **Film**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424`.\n   - **starring**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161`.\n   - **Tom Cruise**: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079`.\n\n2. **SPARQL Query Structure**:\n   - The query selects distinct items where the item is of type Film and Tom Cruise is in the cast.\n\n3. **Validating the Query**:\n   - Ensure that the properties and entities exist in Wikidata and correctly represent the intended relationships.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424;\n    wdt:P161 wd:Q37079.\n}\n```"

According to ER2:\n- `res:Mount_Everest` in DBpedia maps to `Q513` or `Q19977041` in Wikidata.\n- `dbo:locatedInArea` maps to `P131` (located in the area of).\n- `dbo:Country` maps to `Q6256`.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, Mount Everest is an entity (either Q513 or Q19977041), and we're looking for the value of property P131 which points to a country, which is an instance of Q6256.\n\nI need to write a SPARQL query that fetches all countries (wd:Q6256) such that Mount Everest (wd:Q513 or wd:Q19977041) is located there. However, in Wikidata, each entity can have multiple identifiers, so using `wd:Q513` should suffice as the primary identifier for Mount Everest.\n\nThe query structure in Wikidata will be similar to the DBpedia one but using the correct prefixes and namespaces. So, the query should select distinct ?country where Mount Everest (wd:Q513) has the property located in the area of (?p131), and ?country is a subclass of Q6256.\n\nIn Wikidata, the property for located in is P131, so the predicate will be `wdt:P131`. The country should have `wdt:P31` (instance of) `wd:Q6256`.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select distinct ?country, where `wd:Q513 wdt:P131 ?country` and `?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256`.\n\nI should also make sure to use the appropriate prefixes in Wikidata, which are `wd` for entities and properties. The prefixes to define are `wd` for `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>` and `xsd` for XML Schema datatypes, though the latter might not be necessary here.\n\nFinally, I'll write the query ensuring that it's correctly formatted and that variables and prefixes are properly used. Let me check if there are any common mistakes, like using the wrong property or incorrect entity identifiers.\n\nEverything seems to align correctly based on the mappings provided, so the final query should accurately retrieve the countries where Mount Everest is located using Wikidata's data model.\n</think>\n\nTo find the country where Mount Everest is located using Wikidata, we can construct a SPARQL query that leverages the mapped entities and relationships.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Mount Everest** in DBpedia maps to `Q513` in Wikidata.\n   - **Located In** in DBpedia maps to property `P131` in Wikidata.\n   - **Country** in DBpedia maps to `Q6256` in Wikidata (which represents the concept of a country).\n\n2. **Understand the Query Pattern:**\n   The goal is to find all countries where Mount Everest is located. This translates to retrieving entities that are countries and are connected to Mount Everest via the \"located in\" property.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - Use `wd:Q513` for Mount Everest.\n   - Use `wdt:P131` for the \"located in\" property.\n   - Use `wd:Q6256` to identify countries.\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - **SELECT DISTINCT ?country:** To get unique country results.\n   - **WHERE { ... }:** Define the conditions.\n     - **wd:Q513 wdt:P131 ?country:** Mount Everest is located in the country.\n     - **?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256:** The country is an instance of the concept \"country\".\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q513 wdt:P131 ?country.\n  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256.\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all countries where Mount Everest is located by querying the Wikidata knowledge graph."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that mirrors the one provided for DBpedia. The original query is asking where John F. Kennedy was assassinated, which is essentially his death place.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original query:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace> ?uri\n}\n\nThis query uses DBpedia's resources and properties. The main components are the entity (John F. Kennedy) and the relation (deathPlace). The task is to map these to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings:\n- The DBpedia entity for JFK maps to Wikidata's Q9696.\n- The DBpedia deathPlace relation maps to Wikidata's P20.\n\nSo, I need to replace the DBpedia entity and relation with their Wikidata counterparts. In Wikidata, entities are typically prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:'.\n\nTherefore, the subject (John F. Kennedy) becomes wd:Q9696, and the predicate (death place) becomes p:P20.\n\nIn SPARQL, the structure will be similar, but we'll use these Wikidata identifiers. The variable ?uri will still capture the object of the triple, which is the death place.\n\nPutting it all together, the query becomes:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q9696 p:P20 ?uri\n}\n\nThis should return the death place of John F. Kennedy from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the DBpedia query, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations**:\n   - Entity: John F. Kennedy.\n   - Relation: deathPlace.\n\n2. **Use the provided ER2 mappings to map the DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata**:\n   - DBpedia resource `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy>` maps to Wikidata entity `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9696`.\n   - DBpedia property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace>` maps to Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P20`.\n\n3. **Analyze the structure of the DBpedia SPARQL query**:\n   - The query retrieves the death place (`?uri`) of John F. Kennedy.\n   - The query pattern is `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?\";\n   - URI subject and predicate are from DBpedia.\n\n4. **Find the equivalent properties in Wikidata**:\n   - The equivalent property for `deathPlace` is `P20`.\n   - No need for alternative properties since direct mapping exists.\n\n5. **Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity `wd:Q9696` and property `p:P20`.\n\n6. **Validate the final query**:\n   - Ensure the query aligns with Wikidata's data model and syntax.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q9696 p:P20 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let's break down what's given.\n\nFirst, the natural language question is: \"Which river does the Brooklyn Bridge cross?\" The existing DBpedia query uses `dbo:crosses` to find the river. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, the DBpedia resource for Brooklyn Bridge maps to Wikidata's Q125006, and `dbo:crosses` corresponds to Wikidata's P177. In Wikidata, the property P177 indeed represents \"crosses\" or connects entities like bridges and rivers.\n\nSo, the structure of the DBpedia query is selecting the URI where Brooklyn Bridge crosses something. In Wikidata, I'll need to use the same structure but with the correct prefixes and syntax. Wikidata uses `wd:` for entities and `p:` or `ps:` for properties.\n\nPutting it together, I'll start with the prefixes for Wikidata. Then, I'll select the river's URI. The main entity is `wd:Q125006`, and the property is `p:P177`. Since Wikidata's SPARQL uses `ps:` for property statements, I'll structure the query to find which river the bridge crosses.\n\nI should also make sure to use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate results and return just the URIs. That should cover translating the query accurately and effectively.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we need to map the entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings and construct a query in Wikidata's syntax.\n\n1. **Entities and Relations**:\n   - Brooklyn Bridge in DBpedia (`res:Brooklyn_Bridge`) maps to Wikidata (`wd:Q125006`).\n   - The relation `dbo:crosses` in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's property `P177` (crosses).\n\n2. **Wikidata Query Structure**:\n   - Use the Wikidata prefix `wd:` for entities.\n   - Use `p:` for properties and `ps:` for property statements.\n\n3. **Constructing the Query**:\n   - We want to find the river that the Brooklyn Bridge crosses.\n   - Use the property `P177` (crosses) to link the Brooklyn Bridge to the river.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata**:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q125006 wdt:P177 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the river that the Brooklyn Bridge crosses in Wikidata."

The SPARQL query for DBpedia is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Swimmer> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow> }\n\nNow, I need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. Looking at the ER2 mappings provided:\n\n1. Swimmer in DBpedia is mapped to Q10843402 in Wikidata.\n2. birthPlace in DBpedia is mapped to P19 in Wikidata.\n3. Moscow in DBpedia is mapped to Q649 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, we'll need to use these equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, the structure for such a query would involve selecting items where their occupation is Swimmer and their place of birth is Moscow. Wikidata uses 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for properties, followed by a qualifier like 'PS' for the main property.\n\nPutting it all together, the query would select distinct items where the item's occupation is Swimmer (Q10843402) and their place of birth is Moscow (Q649).\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes and structure in the SPARQL query. The query should be in the form of:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE { ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q10843402 ; wdt:P19 wd:Q649 }\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. 'wdt:P106' is for occupation, and 'wdt:P19' is for place of birth. The values are the correct Wikidata entities.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll format it properly as a SPARQL query.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve all swimmers born in Moscow from Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities to Wikidata's equivalents and structure the query accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Map DBpedia Entities to Wikidata:**\n   - Swimmer (DBpedia) \u2192 Q10843402 (Wikidata)\n   - birthPlace (DBpedia) \u2192 P19 (Wikidata)\n   - Moscow (DBpedia) \u2192 Q649 (Wikidata)\n\n2. **Understand the Query Structure:**\n   - Select distinct items where occupation is Swimmer and place of birth is Moscow.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `wdt:P106` for occupation and `wdt:P19` for place of birth.\n   - Link items using semicolons and ensure proper syntax with prefixes.\n\n**Resulting SPARQL Query:**\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P106 wd:Q10843402 ;\n        wdt:P19 wd:Q649\n}\n</sparql>"

Let's start by understanding what the original query is doing.\n\nThe original query is selecting movies that star Alec Guinness and then ordering them by release date in descending order, limiting the result to just one. So it's essentially looking for the most recent movie featuring Alec Guinness.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations in the original query. The main entities are \"Film\" (dbo:Film), \"starring\" (dbo:starring), \"Alec Guinness\" (res:Alec_Guinness), and \"releaseDate\" (dbo:releaseDate).\n\nNext, I check the ER2 mappings provided to find the corresponding Wikidata entities and properties. From the mappings, I see that:\n\n- dbo:Film maps to wikidata:Q11424 (Film)\n- dbo:starring maps to wikidata:P161 (cast member)\n- Alec Guinness maps to wikidata:Q103894\n- dbo:releaseDate maps to wikidata:P577 (publication date)\n\nSo, in Wikidata, instead of using 'starring', we'll use 'cast member' which is P161, and instead of 'releaseDate', we'll use 'publication date' P577.\n\nNow, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. The pattern in the original query is to select films where Alec Guinness is a cast member and then order them by their publication date in descending order, taking the most recent one.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Properties are prefixed with 'wd:' and items with 'wd:Q...' or 'wd: PT...'. For classes, like Film, they are also items, so we can use 'wd:Q11424'.\n\nPutting it all together, the new query should select items where the item is of type Film (wd:Q11424), has Alec Guinness (wd:Q103894) as a cast member via P161, and has a publication date (P577). Then, we order these by the publication date in descending order and limit to one.\n\nI think that's all, so the final query should look something like this:\n</think>\n\nHere's the SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the last movie featuring Alec Guinness:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;  # Film\n        wdt:P161 wd:Q103894 ; # starring Alec Guinness\n        wdt:P577 ?date .    # releaseDate\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?date)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query fetches the most recent movie (by release date) in which Alec Guinness starred, using Wikidata's entities and properties."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The DBpedia query is asking for the second highest mountain by selecting from their Mountain ontology and ordering by elevation descending, then skipping the first result and limiting to one. \n\nFirst, I need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to Wikidata. From the provided ER2 mappings, I see that DBpedia's Mountain class maps to Wikidata's Q8502 for mountains, and the elevation property maps to Wikidata's P2044. \n\nIn Wikidata, entities are often queried using their Q IDs, so I'll need to use Q8502 to represent mountains. The property P2044 stands for elevation, so that will replace DBpedia's elevation property.\n\nNext, I'll structure the query. In DBpedia, the query starts by selecting the URI and then defines the type and property. In Wikidata, we typically use the 'wd:' prefix for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. So, I'll select ?item as the mountain and filter by the mountain type. Then, I'll retrieve the elevation using P2044.\n\nNow, the ordering part. DBpedia uses 'ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1'. Wikidata's SPARQL uses similar syntax, so I'll order by desc(elevation), skip the first result, and take one. But wait, in Wikidata, the elevation is a quantity, and sometimes it's good to set the unit. I'll include a filter to ensure the unit is meters.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the SELECT statement, then the WHERE clause with the necessary bindings for type and elevation. Then, the ORDER BY, OFFSET, and LIMIT clauses. Finally, I'll validate to make sure everything aligns with Wikidata's structure.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mappings and maintain the query's logical structure. Here\u2019s the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: Mountain\n   - **Relation**: elevation\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata**:\n   - **Mountain**: Q8502\n   - **elevation**: P2044\n\n3. **Construct the Query**:\n   - **SELECT**: Retrieve the mountain URI.\n   - **WHERE**:\n     - Bind the mountain type using Q8502.\n     - Retrieve the elevation using P2044.\n   - **ORDER BY**: Sort by elevation in descending order.\n   - **OFFSET 1**: Skip the highest mountain.\n   - **LIMIT 1**: Retrieve the second highest mountain.\n\n4. **Final Query**:\n   - Incorporate the mapped entities and relations into the query structure.\n\nHere\u2019s the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q8502.\n  ?item p:P2044 ?elevation.\n _FILTER EXISTS { ?item p:P2044 _:b1. _:b1 ps:P2044 _:b2. _:b2 p:P1267 _:b3. _:b3 wdt:P3187 \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573\"^^xsd:string. }\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nOFFSET 1\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the second highest mountain in Wikidata by type and elevation, ensuring the result is correctly ordered and limited to the second highest."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original question is about finding the population of Cairo. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the DBpedia SPARQL query. It's using the dbo:populationTotal property to get the population. The prefix dbo refers to DBpedia ontology, and dbr:Cairo is the resource for Cairo in DBpedia.\n\nNow, according to the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia resource for Cairo (dbr:Cairo) maps to two Wikidata entities: Q85 and Q20230483. Since Q85 is the main entity for Cairo, I'll use that.\n\nNext, the DBpedia ontology property dbo:populationTotal maps to Wikidata's P1082, which is population. So, in Wikidata, I should use P1082 to get the population value.\n\nWikidata uses different prefixes, so instead of dbo and dbr, I'll use wdt and wd. So, the property P1082 in Wikidata is represented as wdt:P1082, and the entity Q85 is wd:Q85.\n\nThe variable in the original query is ?pop, and I'll keep that the same. Putting it all together, the WHERE clause in the SPARQL query should select the population value where Cairo is the subject, P1082 is the predicate, and ?pop is the object.\n\nSo, the full query should start with the PREFIX definitions for wdt and wd, then the SELECT clause, and then the WHERE clause linking the entity to the property and variable.\n\nI also need to make sure the syntax is correct, using semicolons and proper indentation if needed, but in SPARQL, the structure is more about the triples. So, I structure it as wdt:P1082 ?pop, but actually, it's the other way around: the subject (wd:Q85) has the property (wdt:P1082) which points to the object (?pop). So, it's wd:Q85 wdt:P1082 ?pop.\n\nPutting it all together, the final query should retrieve the population of Cairo from Wikidata correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mappings.\n\n1. **Mapping Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Cairo** in DBpedia (`dbr:Cairo`) maps to `Q85` in Wikidata.\n   - **Population** in DBpedia (`dbo:populationTotal`) maps to `P1082` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Constructing the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd` and `wdt`.\n   - The query pattern remains the same: retrieve the population where the subject is Cairo and the property is population.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n \nSELECT ?pop \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q85 wdt:P1082 ?pop\n}\n```\n\nThis query fetches the population of Cairo from the Wikidata Knowledge Graph."

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query: it's selecting people who have their birthplace as Heraklion. The query uses DBpedia's ontology, so I need to map those parts to Wikidata's equivalents.\n\nFrom the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia Person class corresponds to Wikidata's Q215627 or Q5. Since both are valid, I'll probably use Q5 as it's the more general entity for \"human.\"\n\nNext, the birthPlace property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P19, which stands for \"place of birth.\" That makes sense.\n\nThen, Heraklion in DBpedia is mapped to Q160544 in Wikidata. So, I'll use that as the target for the birthplace.\n\nNow, thinking about how Wikidata structures its data, the class for a person would be under the occupation or instance, but it's easier to just use the \"wd:\" prefix for the item. So, the type would be something like \"wd:Q5.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct items where each item's place of birth (P19) is Heraklion (Q160544). In Wikidata SPARQL, the prefixes are usually \"wd:\" for entities and \"wds:\" for statements, but I think for direct properties, \"wd\" is sufficient.\n\nI should also ensure that the syntax is correct for Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint, making sure to prefix the query with the appropriate namespaces and using the correct syntax for triples.\n\nSo, translating each part:\n- ?uri a onto:Person becomes ?item wdt:P31/wd:S16 ?person, but maybe a simpler way is to just state the type as \"wd:Q5.\"\n- onto:birthPlace <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraklion> becomes wdt:P19 wd:Q160544.\nI think a straightforward way is to use \"wd:Q5\" for the type and link the birthplace via P19.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the WHERE clause with ?item being of type Q5 and having P19 equal to Q160544.\n\nI should also alias ?uri as ?item for consistency with Wikidata practices. Adding DISTINCT to avoid duplicates is important.\n\nLet me write out the query now, making sure to include all necessary prefixes and the correct syntax. I'll test it in my mind to see if it makes sense and covers the same information as the original DBpedia query.\n\nYes, this should retrieve all the people born in Heraklion using Wikidata's SPARQL syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and relations from the DBpedia query to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Person**: The main entity we're querying.\n   - **Birthplace**: The relation indicating where a person was born.\n   - **Heraklion**: The specific location of interest.\n\n2. **DBpedia to Wikidata Mappings**:\n   - **Person**: Mapped to `wd:Q5`.\n   - **Birthplace**: Mapped to `wdt:P19`.\n   - **Heraklion**: Mapped to `wd:Q160544`.\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata Query**:\n   Using the mappings, we structure the query to find all individuals (entities) of type Person with their birthplace as Heraklion.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .\n  ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q160544 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects all distinct items in Wikidata that are classified as people and have their place of birth listed as Heraklion."

So, in the Wikidata query, I'll use wd:Q58226 to refer to D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\nNow, putting this together, I need to structure the SPARQL query. In Wikidata, properties are usually accessed using the p and ps prefixes. So, for elevation (P2044), I'll use ps:P2044. However, I might also need to include the main statement, so I'll use p:P2044 as well.\n\nThe variable I'm interested in is the elevation value, so I'll name that ?ele. The WHERE clause should specify that the subject is Q58226, and it has the P2044 property with the value ?ele. Using the wds:describedby from the wikibase is important, but I'm not entirely sure how necessary that is in all cases, so including it might help.\n\nI remember that to get a specific result, I should include a LIMIT 1 at the end to ensure only one result is returned, which makes sense since an airport typically has a single elevation value.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should start with the PREFIX statements for Wikidata and the schema. Then, I'll SELECT the elevation variable. The WHERE clause will define the subject, property, and variable. Including the(wallet description from the subject) ensures clarity, although sometimes it's optional, but better safe than sorry.\n\nSo, double-checking everything: subject is Q58226, property is P2044, variable is ?ele. The structure looks correct, and all the mappings are properly used. I think that's all I need to construct the correct SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** D\u00fcsseldorf Airport\n   - **Relation:** elevation\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata:**\n   - **Entity Mapping:** DBpedia's `dbr:D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport` maps to Wikidata's `wd:Q58226`.\n   - **Relation Mapping:** DBpedia's `dbo:elevation` maps to Wikidata's `wdt:P2044`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the `wd` and `wds` prefixes for Wikidata entities and descriptions.\n   - Select the elevation value (`?ele`).\n   - Query for the entity `wd:Q58226` with the property `wdt:P2044`.\n   - Limit the result to a single entry.\n\nHere's the constructed SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?ele WHERE {\n    wd:Q58226 p:P2044 ?ele .\n    ?ele wikibase:quantitativeValue ?numericValue .\n    ?numericValue wikibase:amount ?value .\n    FILTER((LANGMATCHES(LANG('en'), 'en')) || LANG('en') = 'en').\n    LIMIT 1\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nHowever, the above contains some additional components that may not be necessary for a basic query. Simplifying it, the essential query to retrieve the elevation is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?ele WHERE {\n    wd:Q58226 wdt:P2044 ?ele .\n    SERVICE wikibase:label {\n        bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\".\n    }\n    LIMIT 1\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The query structure in SPARQL for Wikidata usually involves the property followed by the item. \n\nI should use the WDQS (Wikidata Query Service) prefix, which is standard. So, the query will start with \"PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\" and \"PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\".\n\nNext, I need to select the country. In Wikidata, to get the direct value, I use \"wdt:P17\".

Sometimes, Wikidata might have multiple values or qualifiers, but since the original query just asks for the country, I think a direct property should suffice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the query should be:\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE {\n  wd:Q5806 wdt:P17 ?country\n}\n\nI think this should work as it directly maps the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo find the country where Mecca is located using Wikidata, we map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata and construct a SPARQL query accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations:**\n   - Mecca is mapped to `wd:Q5806`.\n   - The relation \"country\" is mapped to `wdt:P17`.\n\n2. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT ?country` to get unique results.\n   - Use the WHERE clause to link Mecca (`wd:Q5806`) with its country (`wdt:P17 ?country`).\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE {\n  wd:Q5806 wdt:P17 ?country\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE {\n  wd:Q5806 wdt:P17 ?country\n}\n</sparql>"

It shows that DBpedia's Holiday (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Holiday) maps to Wikidata's Q1445650. So, in Wikidata, the equivalent would be using the property 'wdt:P31' with the value 'wd:Q1445650'.\n\nIn DBpedia, the query is using 'rdf:type' with 'dbo:Holiday'. In Wikidata, 'rdf:type' is represented by 'wdt:P31', and the value is the Wikidata entity, which is 'wd:Q1445650'.\n\nSo, the structure of the query should mirror the DBpedia one but with the appropriate Wikidata prefixes and properties. I should use the same SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650 } structure.\n\nI don't think there are any other relations or entities involved here, so the mapping is straightforward. There's no need for additional triples or filters since the query is simple.\n\nI should also ensure that the prefixes are correctly declared, though in SPARQL, sometimes people omit them if using the default prefixes, but including them doesn't hurt.\n\nWait, Wikidata might not require the 'dbo:' prefix since we're using 'wdt' and 'wd' directly. So the query should be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650 }\n\nThat should accurately translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax.

So this should retrieve all entities in Wikidata that are instances of 'oliday', similar to how it's done in DBpedia.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we first identify the equivalent entities and properties using the provided mappings. The DBpedia `dbo:Holiday` maps to Wikidata's `Q1445650`. The property `rdf:type` in DBpedia corresponds to `wdt:P31` in Wikidata.

They've already provided some context and an example using DBpedia, so I'll use that as a starting point.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original DBpedia query. It's selecting all genres associated with Lou Reed. The structure is straightforward: it's using Lou Reed's DBpedia resource and the genre property to get the URIs of the genres.\n\nNow, the challenge is to map this to Wikidata. From the ER2 mappings provided, I see that Lou Reed in DBpedia corresponds to \"Q189080\" in Wikidata, and the genre property in DBpedia maps to \"P136\" in Wikidata. So I need to replace the DBpedia IRIs with these Wikidata equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, the resource for Lou Reed is \"wd:Q189080\", and the genre is \"wdt:P136\". I also remember that in Wikidata, it's common to use the \"wdt:\" prefix for direct property access.\n\nSo, I'll structure the new query similarly to the DBpedia one but using Wikidata's syntax. Instead of selecting from DBpedia's endpoint, I'll query Wikidata directly. The variable for the genre will be ?genre, and I'll make sure it's distinct to avoid duplicates.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select the distinct genres where Lou Reed is the subject and P136 is the predicate.

So, the key here is to map each part of the DBpedia query to the corresponding Wikidata entities and properties.\n\nStarting with the type, in DBpedia it's <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Holiday>. The ER2 mappings show that this corresponds to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1445650\" in Wikidata, which is 'holiday'.\n\nNext, the 'country' relation in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's 'P17' (country of origin). So, instead of using DBpedia's country property, I'll use P17 in Wikidata.\n\nThen, the specific country is Sweden in DBpedia, which maps to Q34 and Q272930 in Wikidata. It looks like Q34 is the main entity for Sweden, so I'll use that.\n\nPutting this together, in Wikidata, the query should look for items where their type is 'holiday' (Q1445650) and their country (P17) is Sweden (Q34). \n\nWikidata's RDF format uses different prefixes and the 'wds:' prefix for properties. So, I'll structure the query using PREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and specify the class with wds:P31 (instance of) to Q1445650 and the country with wds:P17 to wd:Q34.\n\nI should also make sure to select distinct items to avoid duplicates. The final query needs to be in SPARQL syntax, using the correct prefixes and structure as per Wikidata's setup.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we map the entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let me break down how I arrived at the SPARQL query for Wikidata to answer where Abraham Lincoln died.\n\nFirst, I looked at the original question: \"Where did Abraham Lincoln die?\" This clearly seeks the death place of Abraham Lincoln, so the key entity is Abraham Lincoln, and the relation is his death place.\n\nThe original SPARQL query for DBpedia uses the dbo:deathPlace property. The ER2 mappings provided help convert this to Wikidata's equivalent. From the mappings, I saw that dbo:deathPlace in DBpedia corresponds to P20 in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I considered how to structure the query in Wikidata's syntax. Wikidata uses the wd prefix for entities and p followed by the property number, then ps for the property statement. So, I needed to point to the entity for Abraham Lincoln, which from ER2 is Q91, and the property P20.\n\nThe original query selects the URI of the death place. In Wikidata, to get the value, I use psw:display for the actual name, but since we need the URI, I should focus on the property itself, using ?place as the variable.\n\nPutting this together, I constructed the query starting with the PREFIX declarations for pdb and psw. Then, I wrote the SELECT statement to retrieve ?place. The WHERE clause points to wd:Q91, the subject, and p:P20, the predicate, with ?place as the object. I added optional to include labels for readability.\n\nI made sure to adjust the syntax correctly for Wikidata, using path-based patterns instead of the ontology-based ones in DBpedia. I double-checked that each part maps correctly\u2014ensuring the entity and property are accurately translated from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nFinally, I reviewed the query to confirm it aligns with Wikidata's structure, ensuring it would correctly retrieve the death place of Abraham Lincoln without errors. This led me to the final SPARQL query provided.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata syntax, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations in the DBpedia query:**\n   - Entity: `Abraham_Lincoln`\n   - Relation: `deathPlace`\n   \n2. **Map these to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings:**\n   - `Abraham_Lincoln` is mapped to `Q91`\n   - `deathPlace` is mapped to `P20` (_death place_)\n\n3. **Understand the structure of the DBpedia SPARQL query:**\n   - The query retrieves the URIs of the death place of `Abraham Lincoln`.\n\n4. **Construct the equivalent Wikidata SPARQL query:**\n   - In Wikidata, the query pattern involves using `wd:` for entities and `p:` for properties.\n   - Use `psw:` for property statements.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX psw: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?place\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q91 p:P20 ?place.\n  OPTIONAL {\n    ?place rdfs:label ?placeLabel.\n    FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG('en'), LANG(?placeLabel))).\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original query is asking for the capitals of all countries that the Himalayas run through.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the DBpedia query is doing. It's selecting distinct URIs where the Himalayas are related to a country, and then getting the capital of that country. So, in DBpedia, it's using the properties `country` and `capital` to link the Himalayas to the capitals.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that the Himalayas in DBpedia correspond to three different Wikidata entities: Q105981852, Q26235529, and Q5451. So, in Wikidata, I'll need to use these IDs to represent the Himalayas.\n\nNext, the DBpedia `country` property is mapped to Wikidata's P17, which stands for \"country\". The `capital` property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P36, which is \"capital\". So, I'll replace these properties in the query.\n\nThe structure of the query needs to stay the same. I'll start by selecting the distinct capitals. Then, I'll use the Wikidata triples: the Himalayas (using their Wikidata IDs) connected to P17 to find the countries, and then those countries connected to P36 to find the capitals.\n\nI also notice that in Wikidata, to query multiple entities, I can use the `VALUES` clause. So, I'll list all three Himalayas entities there to ensure I get all relevant countries and their capitals.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the query by selecting the capital, then using the Himalayas entities with P17 to get countries, and then those countries with P36 to get capitals. I'll make sure to use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.\n\nFinally, I'll format it correctly in SPARQL syntax, making sure the prefixes are included for clarity, although sometimes they can be omitted if the endpoint assumes them. But including them makes the query more readable.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation and the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n**Step 1: Identify key entities and relations**\n\n- **Entity**: Himalayas (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas)\n- **Relations**: \n  - country (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country)\n  - capital (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital)\n\n**Step 2: Map entities and relations to Wikidata using ER2**\n\n- **Himalayas**: Q105981852, Q26235529, Q5451\n- **country**: P17\n- **capital**: P36\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Wikidata SPARQL query**\n\nWe'll query for all capitals of countries that the Himalayas pass through.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?mountain { wd:Q105981852 wd:Q26235529 wd:Q5451 }\n  ?mountain wdt:P17 ?country .\n  ?country wdt:P36 ?capital .\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Validate the query**\n\nThis query retrieves the capitals by first identifying the countries associated with each Himalayas entity and then fetching their capitals. The use of `DISTINCT` ensures no duplicate capitals are returned.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?mountain { wd:Q105981852 wd:Q26235529 wd:Q5451 }\n  ?mountain wdt:P17 ?country .\n  ?country wdt:P36 ?capital .\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out which country Limerick Lake is in. I have some background from the user about how they approached this for DBpedia, so I can use that as a starting point.\n\nFirst, the original SPARQL query for DBpedia was:\n\n```\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  res:Limerick_Lake dbo:country ?uri \n}\n```\n\nThis query selects the country related to Limerick Lake using DBpedia's resources and ontology. Now, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that \"Limerick_Lake\" in DBpedia maps to \"Q6386177\" in Wikidata. Similarly, the relation \"country\" in DBpedia, which is \"dbo:country\", maps to \"P17\" in Wikidata. So, the key is to replace the DBpedia resources and properties with their Wikidata counterparts.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are usually prefixed with \"wd:\" and properties with \"p:\". However, in SPARQL, it's common to use the full IRIs or define prefixes for simplicity. Alternatively, I can use the \"wikibase:label\" to get more readable results if needed, but in this case, I just want the country's entity.\n\nSo, to structure the query, I'll set up a triple where the subject is the entity for Limerick Lake (wd:Q6386177), the predicate is the property for country (wdt:P17), and the object is the variable I want to retrieve, let's say ?country.\n\nPutting this together, the basic structure would be:\n\n```\nSELECT ?country \nWHERE \n{ \n  wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?country \n}\n```\n\nThis should return the country associated with Limerick Lake. Using \"wdt:P17\" is the direct property, which gives the value itself, as opposed to \"p:P17\" which would give a statement including possibly qualifiers, etc.\n\nI should also consider if there are any namespaces that need to be declared, but in many cases, especially with tools that support it, the prefixes \"wd:\" and \"wdt:\" are recognized by default.\n\nTesting this query in a Wikidata SPARQL endpoint should give me the correct country. I might want to add a DISTINCT keyword if there are multiple results, but in this case, a lake is typically in one country, so it's probably not necessary, but including it wouldn't hurt for clarity.\n\nSo, the final query would be:\n\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country \nWHERE \n{ \n  wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?country \n}\n```\n\nThis should accurately retrieve the country information from Wikidata for Limerick Lake.\n</think>\n\nTo find the country of Limerick Lake using Wikidata, we've mapped the DBpedia entities to their Wikidata equivalents. The SPARQL query retrieves the country associated with Limerick Lake using the correct Wikidata property.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE { wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?country }\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find Michael Jordan's height, similar to how it was done using DBpedia. Let me start by understanding what was done with DBpedia.\n\nFirst, in the DBpedia query, they used the dbo:height property from the DBpedia ontology. The query fetches the height of the resource Michael_Jordan. The query looks like this:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?num WHERE { res:Michael_Jordan dbo:height ?num }\n\nNow, I have to map this to Wikidata. From the provided ER2 mappings, I see that Michael_Jordan in DBpedia corresponds to Q41421 in Wikidata. The height property in DBpedia (dbo:height) maps to P2048 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the key entities are Michael_Jordan and height. In Wikidata, the entity for Michael Jordan is Q41421, and the property for height is P2048.\n\nI need to construct a SPARQL query using these. In Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using dbo: or res:, we use the WD prefixes. Also, the entity is referenced as wd:Q41421 and the property as p:P2048.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, you typically use the wd: prefix for entities and wds: or p: for properties. The height property is P2048, so it should be referenced as p:P2048.\n\nPutting it together, the query should select the value of P2048 for the entity Q41421, which is Michael Jordan. Usually, in Wikidata, you might also include wdt:P2048 for the main value, but since there might only be one value, I can use that.\n\nSo I'll write the query as:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n \nSELECT DISTINCT ?height \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height \n}\n\nI think that should work. Let me double-check if P2048 is indeed the correct property for height in Wikidata. Yes, that's right, P2048 is \"height\" in Wikidata. And the entity Q41421 is Michael Jordan, so this should fetch his height.\n\nI don't think I need any additional prefixes since I'm using the standard wd and wdt prefixes. The query is straightforward, selecting the height where the subject is Michael Jordan, and the predicate is height.\n\nNo need for any filters unless the height is in a different unit, but the question didn't specify, so retrieving the value directly should suffice.\n\nI think this should be the correct query.\n</think>\n\nTo find Michael Jordan's height using Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to Wikidata's equivalents. Michael Jordan is Q41421, and height is P2048. The SPARQL query retrieves the height value for Q41421.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?height WHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata that will give me the films directed by Clint Eastwood in which he also starred. I have the original query for DBpedia, which is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> }\n\nFrom the ER2 mappings provided, I can see that in DBpedia, 'director' is mapped to Wikidata's P57, 'starring' is P161, and Clint Eastwood's DBpedia resource is Q43203 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, each film is an item, and the properties P57 and P161 are used to denote director and starring actor, respectively, each pointing to Clint Eastwood's item (Q43203).\n\nI'll need to structure the query to select distinct items where both the director and starring actor are Clint Eastwood. In Wikidata, the syntax uses 'wd:' for items and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. Also, for qualifiers like the value of a property, we use 'ps:' followed by the property and then the specific statement.\n\nSo, I should start with a SELECT DISTINCT ?item to get each film. The WHERE clause will have two conditions: one for the director (P57) and one for the starring role (P161). Each condition should use the same Clint Eastwood item (Q43203).\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item p:P57/ps:P57 wd:Q43203 ;\n         p:P161/ps:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n\nWait, is that correct? I think the syntax is that for statements, it's p:P57 followed by ps:P57 wd:Q43203. So it's using 'p:' to indicate the property, and then 'ps:' to specify the value. So each triple in the WHERE clause should represent that the item has the property P57 with value Q43203 and P161 with value Q43203.\n\nAlternatively, since both properties are pointing to the same item, I can write it more succinctly by writing ?item p:P57 ps:P57 wd:Q43203 ; p:P161 ps:P161 wd:Q43203.\n\nI should make sure there's no trailing semicolon and that the syntax is correctly formatted. Also, using DISTINCT ensures we don't get duplicate entries.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Now, let me write the final SPARQL query based on this reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata to find films directed by and starring Clint Eastwood is constructed by mapping the DBpedia properties to their Wikidata equivalents and structuring the query accordingly.\n\n `<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item p:P57/ps:P57 wd:Q43203 ;\n         p:P161/ps:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n</sparql>`"

The ER2 mappings provided will help translate these DBpedia entities to Wikidata.\n\nFrom ER2:\n- The DBpedia property 'currency' maps to Wikidata's 'P38'.\n- The DBpedia resource 'West_African_CFA_franc' maps to 'Q861690' in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the query in Wikidata should select countries where the currency is 'Q861690'. I need to use the Wikidata syntax, which involves prefixes and the triple structure.\n\nI should start with the 'PREFIX' declarations for ns and wdt. Then, structure the query to select distinct countries where the country's currency is the West African CFA franc. Using 'wdt:P38' is correct because it refers to the 'currency' property in Wikidata.\n\nI should make sure the syntax is correct, using 'WHERE' and the correct placement of semicolons. Also, ensuring that the variable for the country is correctly captured as '?country'.\n\nFinally, I'll construct the query to reflect all these points accurately.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we will use the mappings provided in the ER2. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - The DBpedia property `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency` corresponds to Wikidata property `P38`.\n   - The DBpedia resource `http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_African_CFA_franc` corresponds to Wikidata resource `Q861690`.\n\n2. **Query Structure:**\n   The original DBpedia query retrieves all URIs that have the `currency` property set to `West_African_CFA_franc`. In Wikidata, this translates to retrieving all entities that have the `currency` property (`P38`) set to `Q861690`.\n\n3. **Constructing the SPARQL Query:**\n   Using the mappings, we can construct the following Wikidata SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P38 ns:Q861690\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects distinct items (countries) that have the `currency` property (`P38`) set to `West African CFA franc` (`Q861690`).\n\n4. **Validation:**\n   The query is valid under the Wikidata data model, as it uses the correct property (`P38`) and resource (`Q861690`).\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P38 ns:Q861690\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query, it uses the dbo:populationTotal property. The prefix dbo refers to DBpedia's ontology. The query is selecting the population total for Iraq.\n\nNow, I need to map this to Wikidata. From the ER2 mappings provided, I see that the DBpedia resource for Iraq (dbr:Iraq) maps to two Wikidata entities: Q796 and Q3041595. I'll need to include both to cover all possibilities.\n\nNext, the populationTotal property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P1082, which is population. So, I need to use P1082 in the Wikidata query.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are preceded by 'wd:' and properties with 'p:', but when writing SPARQL, we can directly use the full IRIs. However, using prefixes makes the query cleaner. So I'll define the wd and wdt prefixes.\n\nThe structure of the SPARQL query in DBpedia is a simple triple: Iraq has populationTotal. In Wikidata, it's the same concept, so the triple will be Iraq wdt:P1082 ?pIraq.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the query with the prefixes, select the population, and specify the two possible entities for Iraq. This ensures the query works even if one of the entities is used.\n\nFinally, I should validate the query to make sure the syntax is correct and that it fetches the desired result. I think this should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query and mappings, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations in the question:**\n   - **Entity:** Iraq (`dbr:Iraq`)\n   - **Relation:** populationTotal (`dbo:populationTotal`)\n\n2. **Map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the 'er2' mappings:**\n   - `dbr:Iraq` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q796` or `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3041595`.\n   - `dbo:populationTotal` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1082`.\n\n3. **Analyze the structure of the DBpedia SPARQL query:**\n   - It retrieves the value of `populationTotal` for `Iraq`.\n   - The query pattern is `SELECT ?pIraq WHERE { dbr:Iraq dbo:populationTotal ?pIraq }`.\n\n4. **Find the equivalent properties in Wikidata:**\n   - Use `P1082` (population) as the equivalent of `dbo:populationTotal`.\n\n5. **Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax:**\n   - Use the Wikidata entity IRIs and property IRIs.\n   - Maintain the logical structure of the DBpedia query.\n\n6. **Validate the final query:**\n   - Ensure all entities, relationships, and query logic align with Wikidata's data model.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?pIraq \nWHERE {\n  { wd:Q796 wdt:P1082 ?pIraq }\n  UNION\n  { wd:Q3041595 wdt:P1082 ?pIraq }\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that's equivalent to the given DBpedia query. The original query is looking for Greek political parties that are pro-European. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the subject is a PoliticalParty, located in Greece, and has the ideology Pro-Europeanism. The key components here are:\n\n1. The subject is a PoliticalParty.\n2. The country is Greece.\n3. The ideology is Pro-Europeanism.\n\nNow, I need to map these components from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping.\n\nStarting with the PoliticalParty. In DBpedia, it's identified by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty`. The ER2 mapping shows that the equivalent in Wikidata is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7278`. So, I'll replace `a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty>` with `wd:Q7278`.\n\nNext, the country is Greece in DBpedia, which is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece`. In Wikidata, this maps to two entities: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41` and `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q194327`. Since I'm querying for the country of origin, I'll use the 'country' property, which is `P17` in Wikidata. So, I'll replace `dbpedia:country` with `wdt:P17` and the value with `wd:Q41`.\n\nNow, the ideology is Pro-Europeanism in DBpedia, which is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pro-Europeanism`. The Wikidata mappings are `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3781399` and `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1377153`. I'll need to use the property for ideology, which in Wikidata is `P1142`. So, the ideology part will be `wdt:P1142` with the value set to either `wd:Q3781399` or `wd:Q1377153`. I'll include both to cover possible entries.\n\nPutting it all together, the query structure should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31/wd:Q7278.\n  ?uri wdt:P17 wd:Q41.\n  ?uri wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399, wd:Q1377153.\n}\n\nWait, I recall that `wdt:P31` is used for 'instance of', so I should use that to specify that the subject is a political party. So the first triple becomes `?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q7278`.\n\nI also need to ensure that the query is correctly formatted. So, the final query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q7278 ;\n    wdt:P17 wd:Q41 ;\n    wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399, wd:Q1377153 .\n}\n\nI think that's correct. It selects all entities that are instances of political party, located in Greece, and have an ideology of Pro-Europeanism, using the appropriate Wikidata properties and entities.\n</think>\n\nTo query Wikidata for Greek political parties that are pro-European, we construct the SPARQL query by mapping the DBpedia components to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q7278 ;\n    wdt:P17 wd:Q41 ;\n    wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399, wd:Q1377153 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the desired information by utilizing the correct Wikidata properties and entities."

It used three main parts: the show \"Charmed,\" the \"starring\" relation to connect to the actors, and the \"birthDate\" to get their birthdays.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that \"Charmed\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"Q162371\" in Wikidata. The \"starring\" relation maps to \"P161,\" which in Wikidata is \"cast member.\" The \"birthDate\" is \"P569,\" so that's straightforward.\n\nSo, I'll start by structuring the query to get the actors of \"Charmed.\" I'll use WD:Q162371 for the show. Then, I'll use the \"P161\" property to link to the actors. From there, I want to get each actor's birthdate, which is \"P569.\"\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. I need to make sure I'm using the correct prefixes and that the query is formatted properly. I'll use \"PREFIX\" statements to define the namespaces. The variables will be \"actor\" and \"birthdate.\"\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select distinct birthdates where \"Charmed\" has a cast member, and then get their birthdates. I have to be careful with the syntax, making sure there's no trailing dots and that everything is properly closed.\n\nI should also validate the query to ensure it runs correctly on Wikidata. Maybe test it in the query service to see if it returns the expected results. If it does, then I know I've constructed it right.\n\nAlright, I think I have all the pieces now. Let me write out the full query with all the components included.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we will follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Charmed (TV Show):** Mapped to `wd:Q162371`.\n   - **Starring Relation:** Mapped to `wdt:P161`.\n   - **Birth Date:** Mapped to `wdt:P569`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - **Select:** Retrieve distinct `?birthdate`.\n   - **Where:** \n     - `wd:Q162371` (Charmed) is related via `wdt:P161` (starring) to `?actor`.\n     - `?actor` has a `wdt:P569` (birth date) value `?birthdate`.\n\n3. **SPARQL Syntax:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declarations for namespaces.\n   - Structure the query to ensure correct syntax and logic.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?birthdate \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q162371 wdt:P161 ?actor .\n  ?actor wdt:P569 ?birthdate .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to create the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information. \n\nFirst, the original question is asking about the artistic movement of the painter who created \"The Three Dancers\". The existing SPARQL query uses DBpedia to find this information. Now, I need to convert this query to use Wikidata instead.\n\nLooking at the provided ER2 mappings, I see that:\n- \"The Three Dancers\" in DBpedia maps to \"Q3235867\" in Wikidata.\n- The \"author\" property in DBpedia maps to \"P50\" in Wikidata.\n- The \"movement\" property in DBpedia maps to \"P135\" in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to structure the Wikidata query to follow the same pattern as the DBpedia query but using these Wikidata identifiers.\n\nIn the DBpedia query, the painter's artwork is identified, and then their movement is queried. In Wikidata, the structure is similar, but the prefixes and property identifiers are different.\n\nI should start by defining the appropriate prefixes for Wikidata. Instead of using 'dbo' and 'res', I'll use 'wd' for the main Wikidata entities and 'wds' for the sitelinks if necessary.\n\nThe query pattern involves selecting the movement, which is the object of the \"P135\" property. The subject is the painter, who is the object of the \"P50\" property for the artwork \"Q3235867\".\n\nSo, putting it all together, the query should select the movement (?movement) where \"Q3235867\" has a creator (P50) who in turn has a movement (P135).\n\nI remember that in Wikidata SPARQL, the syntax is a bit different. I might need to use 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. Wait, no, usually, it's 'wd:' for items and 'wds:' for sitelinks, but properties are often referenced with their own prefixes or using 'wdt:' for direct access.\n\nAlternatively, using the 'p' and 'ps' prefixes might be necessary for accessing the properties and their values. However, I'm a bit confused about whether to use 'wdt' or 'p' for the properties here.\n\nBut looking at examples, it's common to use 'wdt:' for property access. So, reconstructing the query:\n\n- Start with the artwork \"Q3235867\".\n- Use 'wdt:P50' to get the author.\n- Then, from the author, use 'wdt:P135' to get the movement.\n\nSo, in the query, I'll select ?movement such that:\n- The artwork has a P50 (author) linking to some ?person.\n- That ?person has a P135 (movement) linking to ?movement.\n\nI don't think I need to filter or specify which ?person it is because the Patterson query seems to collect all possible movements, just like the DBpedia one used 'DISTINCT'.\n\nNow, writing the SPARQL query:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n    wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n    ?person wdt:P135 ?item .\n    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language 'en' }\n}\n\nHmm, but wait, in the original instruction, the query in DBpedia didn't label the results, but maybe in Wikidata, including labels would be helpful. So, I added the SERVICE part for labels, but the original instruction didn't specify whether to include that. However, since the final answer didn't include labels, maybe I shouldn't add them unless instructed.\n\nSo perhaps the correct query is just selecting the movement without labels.\n\nTherefore, the final SPARQL query would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?movement WHERE {\n    wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n    ?person wdt:P135 ?movement .\n}\n\nI think that's it. It selects the movement of the person who is the author of \"The Three Dancers\". Let me double-check the mappings to make sure I didn't mix up any properties. P50 is creator, P135 is movement. Yes, that matches. So this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo adapt the DBpedia SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings and adjust the query syntax accordingly. The original query retrieves the artistic movement of the painter who created \"The Three Dancers\". \n\nHere's how the mapping works:\n- \"The Three Dancers\" in DBpedia corresponds to `Q3235867` in Wikidata.\n- The `dbo:author` property corresponds to `wdt:P50` in Wikidata.\n- The `dbo:movement` property corresponds to `wdt:P135` in Wikidata.\n\nThe adapted SPARQL query for Wikidata is as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?movement WHERE {\n    wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n    ?person wdt:P135 ?movement .\n}\n```\nThis query retrieves the movement(s) associated with the painter who created \"The Three Dancers\" using Wikidata's property identifiers.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?movement WHERE {\n    wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n    ?person wdt:P135 ?movement .\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query into a Wikidata SPARQL query. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking for actors born in Germany. The DBpedia query does this by selecting URIs where either the birthPlace is directly Germany or the birthPlace's country is Germany. So, I need to map these concepts from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided:\n\n1. The Actor concept in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q33999. So, in Wikidata, we'll use `wd:Q33999`.\n2. The birthPlace property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P19, so we'll use `p:P19`.\n3. Germany in DBpedia is mapped to several Wikidata entities (Q43287, Q183, Q41304), but I think we can just use the main one, `wd:Q183`.\n4. The country property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P17, so `p:P17`.\n\nNow, looking at the DBpedia SPARQL structure:\n\n- It's a SELECT DISTINCT query for ?uri.\n- There are two conditions:\n  1. ?uri is an Actor with birthPlace directly pointing to Germany.\n  2. ?uri has a birthPlace which itself has a country of Germany.\n\nIn Wikidata, properties are different. Instead of using triples like in DBpedia, we use a different syntax. So, for each statement, we'll need to structure it properly.\n\nI'll start by selecting the actors using the Occupation property. So, the first part is `?actor wdt:P106/wd:Q33999`. This means the actor's occupation is acting.\n\nNext, for the birthPlace condition:\n\n1. The direct birth place in Germany: `?actor wdt:P19 ?birthPlace . ?birthPlace wdt:P17 wd:Q183`.\n2. Alternatively, the birthPlace could be directly Germany: `?actor wdt:P19 wd:Q183`.\n\nI need to combine these two conditions using a UNION so that it covers both possibilities. The UNION operator in SPARQL allows us to handle these two separate cases in one query.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to first select the actor, then check either their birthPlace is Germany directly or through the country property.\n\nI should also include a DISTINCT clause to avoid duplicate results, as the actor might be returned multiple times through different triples.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the syntax is correct for Wikidata, using `wdt:` for property values and proper prefixes. I don't think any special prefixes are needed beyond the default `wd:` and `wdt:`.\n\nLet me write this out and double-check if it makes sense. The query selects actors who are born in Germany either directly or through their birthPlace's country. The structure with UNION should handle both cases without missing any actors. Also, using `wd:Q33999` correctly identifies the actors by their occupation.\n\nI think that's it. The final SPARQL query should look like the one I provided, covering both direct and indirect birthPlace conditions for Germany.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation and the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:  \n   - **Actor**: Mapped to `wd:Q33999` (Wikidata entity for actor).\n   - **Birth Place**: Mapped to `p:P19` (Wikidata property for place of birth).\n   - **Germany**: Mapped to `wd:Q183` (primary Wikidata entity for Germany).\n   - **Country**: Mapped to `p:P17` (Wikidata property for country).\n\n2. **Construct the Query**:  \n   - Retrieve all actors who were born in Germany either directly or through their birth place's country.\n\n3. **SPARQL Query**:  \n   ```sparql\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?actor\n   WHERE \n   {\n     ?actor wdt:P106/wd:Q33999.  # Actor's occupation is acting\n     {\n       ?actor wdt:P19 ?birthPlace.  # Actor's birth place\n       ?birthPlace wdt:P17 wd:Q183.  # Birth place's country is Germany\n     }\n     UNION\n     {\n       ?actor wdt:P19 wd:Q183.  # Actor's birth place is directly Germany\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   However, to match the exact structure of the DBpedia query, we adjust it slightly:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?actor\nWHERE\n{\n  ?actor wdt:P106/wd:Q33999 ;\n         wdt:P19 ?birthPlace .\n  {\n    ?birthPlace wdt:P17 wd:Q183 .\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?actor wdt:P19 wd:Q183 .\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut to make it concise and efficient, the final query is:\n\n<spaqrl>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?actor\nWHERE\n{\n  ?actor wdt:P106/wd:Q33999 .\n  {\n    ?actor wdt:P19 ?birthPlace .\n    ?birthPlace wdt:P17 wd:Q183 .\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?actor wdt:P19 wd:Q183 .\n  }\n}\n</sparql>"

Let me go through the steps.\n\nFirst, I look at the original DBpedia query. It uses dbo:architect to find the architect of the Brooklyn Bridge. So, the main entities are Brooklyn Bridge and the architect relation.\n\nFrom the ER2 mappings, I know that the DBpedia Brooklyn Bridge is linked to Wikidata's Q125006. The architect relation in DBpedia (dbo:architect) maps to Wikidata's P84.\n\nNow, I need to switch from DBpedia to Wikidata syntax. In Wikidata, we use prefix wdt: for properties. So, instead of dbo:architect, I'll use wdt:P84.\n\nThe structure of the SPARQL query in DBpedia is SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Brooklyn_Bridge dbo:architect ?uri }. I need to mirror this in Wikidata.\n\nI'll replace res:Brooklyn_Bridge with wd:Q125006 because that's the Wikidata ID. The property becomes wdt:P84, and I'll project the variable ?architect instead of ?uri.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the query with the appropriate prefixes and structure. Ensuring that all syntax is correct for Wikidata, I'll make sure there are no errors in the query format.\n\nI should also check if P84 is indeed the right property in Wikidata for architects.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to find out who composed the Game of Thrones theme. I know the answer is Ramin Djawadi, but I'm trying to figure out how to construct a SPARQL query on Wikidata to get this information. \n\nFirst, I remember that the original SPARQL query was for DBpedia, and I need to translate that to Wikidata. The original query was:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n    res:Game_of_Thrones dbo:composer ?uri \n}\n\nSo, in DBpedia, they're using 'dbo:composer' to link 'Game_of_Thrones' to the composer. Now, I need to map this to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided:\n\n1. The DBpedia resource 'Game_of_Thrones' maps to Wikidata's Q23572.\n2. The DBpedia property 'dbo:composer' maps to Wikidata's P86.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I should be using P86 as the property that connects the item Q23572 (Game of Thrones) to the composer.\n\nWikidata's SPARQL syntax is a bit different from DBpedia. Instead of using prefixes like 'dbo:' and 'res:', we use the full URIs or registered prefixes. The standard prefix for Wikidata is 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. Alternatively, we can use the full IRIs.\n\nI think using 'wd:' is more common. So, 'wd:Q23572' would be the identifier for Game of Thrones, and 'p:P86' would be the property for composer. However, I'm not entirely sure if it's 'p:P86' or 'ps:P86' for statements. Maybe I should check, but I recall that for the main property, 'p:' is used, and 'ps:' is for the qualifiers. So, probably, it's 'p:P86'.\n\nNow, putting it together, the query should select the composer where Game of Thrones (wd:Q23572) has the property p:P86.\n\nSo, the basic structure would be:\n\nSELECT ?composer \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q23572 p:P86 ?composer .\n}\n\nBut I've seen examples where people specify more details, like labels, but since the question is just asking for the URI, maybe we can return just the composer's IRI. Wait, actually, in Wikidata, 'p:P86' will give us the entity, but sometimes it's represented with a statement, so we might need to use 'ps:P86' for the actual value. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, no. In Wikidata, the property 'P86' is 'composer', so using 'p:P86' directly in the query should link the subject to the object, which is the composer. So, the query 'wd:Q23572 p:P86 ?composer' should get me the composer's entity.\n\nBut I think I should test the structure. Let's see an example:\n\nIn Wikidata, to get the composer of Game of Thrones, you'd query where Game of Thrones is the subject, P86 is the predicate. So, the object is the composer.\n\nSo, the SPARQL query would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?composer \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q23572 wdt:P86 ?composer\n}\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Because in Wikidata, you can use 'wdt:' for direct properties. So, 'wdt:P86' would be the direct property. Alternatively, 'p:P86' is used in the context of statements with qualifiers.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to use 'wdt:P86' to directly get the value of the 'composer' property.\n\nLet me double-check. According to Wikidata's documentation, 'wdt:' is a prefix for accessing direct values of properties, while 'p:' is for the statements including possible qualifiers. Since I just need the composer, using 'wdt:' should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the query would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> \nSELECT ?composer \nWHERE { \n    wd:Q23572 wdt:P86 ?composer \n}\n\nAlternatively, since sometimes in SPARQL queries, people just use the full URLs, but using prefixes is cleaner.\n\nWait, but in the example I saw earlier, sometimes they don't need to define 'wdt:', but I'm not sure. Maybe it's safer to include the prefix.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final SPARQL query would use 'wd:Q23572' as the subject, 'wdt:P86' as the predicate, and select the object which is the composer.\n</think>\n\nTo find who composed the Game of Thrones theme using Wikidata, we map the DBpedia query to Wikidata's entities and properties. Using the ER2 mappings, 'Game_of_Thrones' corresponds to Q23572, and 'composer' is P86. The SPARQL query uses the direct property 'wdt:P86' to retrieve the composer.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?composer \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q23572 wdt:P86 ?composer\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that's equivalent to the given DBpedia query. The original query is asking for all movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query: It uses the ontology (dbo:) and resource (res:) prefixes. The query selects distinct URIs where the URI is of type Film and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. So, the key triples here are:\n- ?uri rdf:type dbo:Film\n- ?uri dbo:director res:Francis_Ford_Coppola\n\nNow, I have the ER2 mappings that connect DBpedia to Wikidata. The first mapping is for Film, which in DBpedia is dbo:Film, and the equivalent in Wikidata is Q11424. Next, the director property in DBpedia is dbo:director, which maps to P57 in Wikidata. Lastly, Francis Ford Coppola as a resource in DBpedia is res:Francis_Ford_Coppola, mapping to Q56094 in Wikidata.\n\nOkay, so in Wikidata, the director is represented by property P57, and the entity is Q56094. The type Film in DBpedia is Q11424 in Wikidata. So I need to structure the SPARQL query using these entities.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are often referenced with their Q numbers, and properties with P numbers. So I'll need to use the wdt: prefix for the property and the wd: prefix for the entity.\n\nSo translating the triples:\n- ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 (since wdt:P31 is 'instance of', which is like rdf:type)\n- ?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q56094 (this is the director)\n\nI think that's the correct mapping. Also, since Wikidata doesn't require the RDF type syntax, using wdt:P31 covers the instance of Film.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SELECT DISTINCT query to get all such URIs where those two conditions are met. I should also include prefixes for clarity.\n\nI should test this mentally: Does wdt:P31 correspond correctly to the type? Yes, because P31 is 'instance of'. And P57 is the director. So yes, this should fetch all films directed by Francis Ford Coppola in Wikidata.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any missing parts, so the query should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves all movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola, we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Francis Ford Coppola \u2192 Q56094\n   - **Relation:** director \u2192 P57\n   - **Entity Type:** Film \u2192 Q11424\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata Syntax:**\n   - Use `wdt:P31` for 'instance of' (Film).\n   - Use `wdt:P57` for the director relationship.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Select distinct URIs (`?uri`) that are instances of Film and directed by Q56094.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n    ?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q56094 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the original DBpedia query, the query was retrieving Adele's birth name using the dbo:birthName property. So, in the query, it's selecting ?bn where dbr:Adele has the dbo:birthName property.\n\nNow, looking at the provided ER2 mappings, I see that dbr:Adele maps to Q23215 in Wikidata, and dbo:birthName maps to P1477, which is the 'birth name' property in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the structure of the DBpedia query was to get the birth name of Adele. Therefore, in Wikidata, I need to find the same information but using their respective identifiers.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are referred to by their Q numbers, like Q23215, and properties by their P numbers, like P1477. So I need to query the entity Q23215 and look for the property P1477.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure should be similar: SELECT ?bn WHERE { Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn }. That translates to selecting the birth name where Adele (Q23215) has the property P1477 (birth name).\n\nI also need to make sure I use the correct prefixes or namespace in the query. In Wikidata, you can use the full URIs or the short forms like p: or wdt:.\n\nI think in Wikidata SPARQL, using wd: for entities and p: for properties is standard. However, sometimes the direct property is accessed with wdt:predicate. So, I should verify which one is correct.\n\nI recall that in Wikidata, to get the actual value, you often use wdt: followed by the property, and for managed entities, you can use wd: followed by the Q number.\n\nSo updating the query, it would be more accurate to write it as SELECT ?bn WHERE { wd:Q23215 wdt:P1477 ?bn }.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The standard way to query properties in Wikidata is using the wdt: namespace for the claims. So for property P1477, I should use wdt:P1477.\n\nAlso, using the wd: prefix for the entity, so wd:Q23215 would represent Adele in Wikidata.\n\nSo the correct structure would be SELECT ?bn WHERE { wd:Q23215 wdt:P1477 ?bn }.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe should I specify the label or any other details, but the original query just asks for the birth name, so this should suffice.\n\nI should make sure the syntax is correct, with proper use of prefixes and curly braces. Let me write it out.\n\nPutting it all together, the query would start with PREFIX declarations, but in Wikidata, often the wd: and wdt: prefixes are predefined, so I might not need to declare them. But to be safe, perhaps including them.\n\nWait, in some SPARQL endpoints, you have to declare the prefixes, but others have default ones. Assuming that the user will be querying the endpoint where wd: and wdt: are already defined, but to be thorough, I can include the PREFIX lines.\n\nSo, the final query would be:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?bn\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q23215 wdt:P1477 ?bn\n}\n\nAlternatively, if the endpoints allow it without the prefixes, but I think including them is better practice.\n\nI think this should correctly fetch the birth name of Adele from Wikidata. Let me double-check by recalling that Adele's birth name is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, so if I run this query, it should return that name.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So this should be the correct SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo find Adele's birth name in Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided mappings. Adele is Q23215 in Wikidata, and the birth name property is P1477. The SPARQL query retrieves the value of P1477 for Q23215.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?bn\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q23215 wdt:P1477 ?bn\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query that finds the first Queen album. \n\nFirst, I look at the DBpedia query. It selects albums by Queen, orders them by release date, and limits the result to one. The key parts are the rdf:type for Album, artist as Queen, and releaseDate.\n\nNext, I refer to the ER2 mappings provided. Each DBpedia entity has a corresponding Wikidata ID. For example, dbo:Album maps to wd:Q482994, dbo:artist maps to P175, Queen (band) is Q15862, and releaseDate is P577.\n\nSo, I need to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax. Instead of using the DBpedia ontology, I'll use the Wikidata properties. The query structure should remain similar: select the album URI where it's of type Q482994, has artist Q15862, and order by release date.\n\nI have to remember that in Wikidata, the main entity is of type 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q482994', and the artist is linked using P175. Instead of dbo:releaseDate, I'll use P577.\n\nI should also ensure that the SPARQL syntax is correct for Wikidata, using the right prefixes or exiting them as needed. The query should fetch the label or URI, order by the release date, and limit to the first one.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select the album URI, filter by type and artist, order by release date, and limit the result to one.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata that identifies the first Queen album, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Map DBpedia Elements to Wikidata:**\n   - Album type: `dbo:Album` \u2192 `wd:Q482994`\n   - Artist relation: `dbo:artist` \u2192 `P175`\n   - Queen (band): `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_(band)` \u2192 `wd:Q15862`\n   - Release Date relation: `dbo:releaseDate` \u2192 `P577`\n\n2. **Adapt the Query Structure:**\n   - Select the album URI.\n   - Filter by album type, artist, and ensure ordering by release date.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the `?uri` to represent the album.\n   - Filter by type and artist using the mapped properties.\n   - Order by release date in ascending order.\n   - Limit to the first result.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ;\n    wdt:P175 wd:Q15862 ;\n    wdt:P577 ?date .\n}\nORDER BY ASC(?date)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the first album by Queen based on the release date in Wikidata."

Similarly, the DBpedia ontology for currency (dbo:currency) maps to Wikidata's P38. \n\nSo, in Wikidata, instead of using dbo:currency, I should use wdt:P38. Also, the entity for the Czech Republic will be wd:Q213 instead of res:Czech_Republic. \n\nI remember that in Wikidata SPARQL, the prefix 'wd' is used for entities and 'wdt' for properties.

The original query in DBpedia is asking for all people who were born in Vienna and died in Berlin. \n\nFirst, I should look at the ER2 mappings provided. There are four mappings here: two for the properties (birthPlace and deathPlace) and two for the places (Vienna and Berlin). \n\nFor the birthPlace, the DBpedia ID maps to Wikidata's P19. So in the query, I'll use P19 instead of the DBpedia ontology. Similarly, deathPlace in DBpedia is P20 in Wikidata. \n\nNext, the places: Vienna in DBpedia is Q1741 in Wikidata. That's straightforward. Berlin is a bit more complex because it has multiple Wikidata entries: Q64, Q31910788, Q56036, Q56037. I need to include all of them in the query. \n\nThe original SPARQL query uses a SELECT DISTINCT to get all the URIs where the person has birthPlace Vienna and deathPlace Berlin. In Wikidata, I'll follow the same structure but use the P19 and P20 properties and the corresponding QIDs for Vienna and Berlin.\n\nSo I'll start with PREFIX to define the namespaces, but since Wikidata uses the wd: prefix for entities and p: and ps: for properties, I might not need explicit prefixes beyond what's standard.\n\nI'll structure the query to select distinct ?item where ?item has P19 and P20, each pointing to their respective places. But since Berlin has multiple entries, I'll need to cover all possibilities. Maybe using a FILTER that includes all the possible QIDs for Berlin. Alternatively, I can list each Berlin place as a separate value in the triple. \n\nI think the best approach is to list each possible Berlin entity in the deathPlace triple, so the query returns anyone whose deathPlace is any of those Berlin entities.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the SPARQL query using the Wikidata syntax, ensuring that the properties and places are correctly mapped and listed.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings and follow the structure of the original DBpedia query.\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations**: The query seeks people with birthplace Vienna and deathPlace Berlin.\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata**:\n   - `dbpedia:birthPlace` \u2192 `wikidata:P19`\n   - `dbpedia:deathPlace` \u2192 `wikidata:P20`\n   - `dbpedia:Vienna` \u2192 `wikidata:Q1741`\n   - `dbpedia:Berlin` maps to multiple Wikidata entities: `Q64`, `Q31910788`, `Q56036`, `Q56037`.\n\n3. **Construct Query**: Use the mapped properties and entities in the WHERE clause, including all Berlin entities.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item p:P19 [ ps:P19 wd:Q1741 ] .\n  ?item p:P20 [ ps:P20 ( wd:Q64, wd:Q31910788, wd:Q56036, wd:Q56037 ) ] .\n}\n```\n\nHowever, to ensure it correctly captures all individuals with deathPlace as any of the Berlin entities, the optimal query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q1741 ;\n       p:P20 [\n           ps:P20/wdt:P20 [\n               wd:DNONEOF (wd:Q64, wd:Q31910788, wd:Q56036, wd:Q56037)\n           ]\n       ] .\n}\n```\n\nBut since the exact syntax might vary, the correct approach is to explicitly list each possible Berlin entity:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q1741 ;\n    wdt:P20 wd:Q64, wd:Q31910788, wd:Q56036, wd:Q56037 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects all distinct items that have birthPlace Vienna and deathPlace in any of the specified Berlin entities in Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original query is asking for bridges that cross the Seine. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Bridge> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/crosses> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine> }\n\nThis query is selecting all distinct URIs where the URI is of type Bridge and crosses the Seine.\n\nNow, the ER2 mappings provided map the DBpedia entities to Wikidata:\n- DBpedia's Bridge ontology maps to Wikidata's Q12280.\n- DBpedia's 'crosses' property maps to Wikidata's P177.\n- DBpedia's Seine resource maps to Wikidata's Q1142326 and Q1471.\n\nSo, I need to translate each part of the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nIn Wikidata, the 'instance of' is handled using P31. So instead of using 'a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Bridge>', I should use P31 with the value Q12280.\n\nNext, the 'crosses' property in DBpedia maps to P177 in Wikidata, so that part translates directly.\n\nFor the Seine, there are two possible entities: Q1142326 and Q1471. In SPARQL, I can handle this by using the VALUES clause to include both possibilities.\n\nPutting it together, the structure becomes:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 ;\n       wdt:P177 [] .\n  VALUES ?val { wd:Q1142326 wd:Q1471 }\n  FILTER(?uri != ?val)\n}\n\nWait, actually, I should make sure that the 'crosses' property is pointing to one of the Seine entities. The syntax for that in Wikidata is using the property P177 followed by the Seine's entity.\n\nSo, the correct way is:\n?uri wdt:P177 ?seine .\nAnd then define ?seine as either Q1142326 or Q1471 using VALUES.\n\nWait, no, because in the original DBpedia query, the bridge's 'crosses' property directly points to the Seine resource. So in Wikidata, it should be the same structure.\n\nTherefore, the corrected query would be:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 ;\n       wdt:P177 ?seine .\n  VALUES ?seine { wd:Q1142326 wd:Q1471 }\n}\n\nBut I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe original query structure is:\n?uri a Bridge; crosses Seine.\n\nIn Wikidata, that translates to:\n?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 ;  # ?uri is a Bridge\n              wdt:P177 ?seine . # ?uri crosses ?seine\nVALUES ?seine { wd:Q1142326 wd:Q1471 }  # ?seine is either of the two Seine entities.\n\nThis seems correct, so the final query would have the VALUES clause for the object of P177.\n\nI should also ensure that the syntax is correct, using 'wdt:' for direct property access and 'wd:' for entities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query should correctly fetch all bridges in Wikidata that cross either of the Seine entities.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed by mapping each component of the DBpedia query to its Wikidata equivalent. Here's how it's done:\n\n- **Bridge**: Mapped to Wikidata's Q12280 using `wdt:P31`.\n- **Crosses**: Mapped to Wikidata's P177 using `wdt:P177`.\n- **Seine**: Mapped to both Q1142326 and Q1471 using `VALUES`.\n\nThis results in the following query:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 ;\n       wdt:P177 ?seine .\n  VALUES ?seine { wd:Q1142326 wd:Q1471 }\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking which musician wrote the most books. The DBpedia SPARQL query is selecting the URI of musicians who have authored books, ordering them by the count of books they've written, and limiting the result to just one.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia properties and resources are mapped to their corresponding Wikidata entities. For example, the DBpedia property for occupation is mapped to Wikidata's P106, and \"Musician\" is mapped to Q639669. Similarly, \"author\" maps to P50, and \"Book\" maps to Q571.\n\nSo, the next step is to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax. In DBpedia, the query uses triple patterns to find musicians and their authored books. In Wikidata, the structure is a bit different but similar in concept.\n\nI notice that in the DBpedia query, they're using `?uri` to represent the musician and `?x` as the book. In Wikidata, I can structure it similarly using `?musician` and `?book`.\n\nThe important parts to map are:\n1. `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation>` becomes `wdt:P106`.\n2. `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musician>` becomes `wd:Q639669`.\n3. `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/author>` becomes `wdt:P50`.\n4. `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Book>` becomes `wd:Q571`.\n\nNow, constructing the Wikidata query. I'll need to select `?musician` and count the number of books they've written. The query pattern involves linking the musician's occupation, their role as an author, and ensuring the books are of the correct type.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should:\n- Select `?musician` and count `?book`.\n- Use `wdt:P106` to state the occupation is Musician (wd:Q639669).\n- Use `wdt:P50` to link the musician to the book.\n- Ensure the book is of type wd:Q571.\n\nI'll order the results by the descending count to find the musician with the most books and limit it to one result.\n\nI also need to make sure the syntax is correct. Wikidata uses `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>)` and `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`. The main triple patterns are straightforward, and the count should be applied correctly.\n\nSo, the final query should look something like selecting the musician and the count of books, where the musician is an author, and the book is a type of book. Then order by count descending and limit to one.\n</think>\n\nTo answer which musician wrote the most books in Wikidata, we construct the following SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?musician (COUNT(?book) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n    ?musician wdt:P106 wd:Q639669.\n    ?book wdt:P50 ?musician.\n    ?book wdt:P31 wd:Q571.\n}\nGROUP BY ?musician\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query selects musicians, counts their authored books, and identifies the top one."

So, in DBpedia, the relevant entities and properties are:\n\n- TelevisionShow (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TelevisionShow)\n- creator (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator)\n- John Cleese (http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cleese)\n\nNow, I have the ER2 mappings that connect DBpedia entities to Wikidata.

The creator property in DBpedia is mapped to P170 in Wikidata. P170 stands for \"creator\" in Wikidata, so that fits perfectly.\n\n3. John Cleese in DBpedia is mapped to Q25014 in Wikidata. That's his unique identifier there.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I need to find all items in Wikidata that are instances of Q15416 (television shows) and have P170 (creator) pointing to Q25014 (John Cleese).\n\nIn SPARQL for Wikidata, I'll structure it with a WHERE clause that includes these two conditions. I'll use variable ?item to represent each television show. The DISTINCT keyword ensures I get unique results.\n\nI don't see any direct equivalents that are different; everything maps neatly. So the query should look like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P170 wd:Q25014.\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q15416.\n}\n\nThat should do it.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query and the mappings provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer> ;\n    <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature>\n}\n```\nThis query is selecting all distinct URIs where the resource is a Writer and has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nNow, I need to map the DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings provided. Let's look at the ER2 mappings:\n\n1. For \"Writer\", the DBpedia ID is mapped to Wikidata's Q36180.\n2. The \"award\" relation in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P166.\n3. The \"Nobel Prize in Literature\" is mapped to Q37922 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, translating each part:\n- `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer>` becomes `wd:Q36180`\n- `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award>` becomes `wdt:P166`\n- `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature>` becomes `wd:Q37922`\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the prefix `wd` is used for entities, and `wdt` for properties. The query structure in Wikidata typically uses `?item` instead of `?uri`, so I'll adjust that as well.\n\nPutting it all together, the query in Wikidata should select distinct items where each item is an instance of Writer (P31) and has received the award (P166) of Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, to denote that something is a writer, we usually use P31 (instance of) with Q36180 (writer). So the first part would be `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180`.\n\nThen, the second part is the award, so `?item wdt:P166 wd:Q37922`.\n\nSo the WHERE clause should have both these conditions.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should be:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n    wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n```\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check the mappings and structure to make sure I haven't missed anything. Yes, P31 is used for \"instance of\", which aligns with the DBpedia's \"a\" for type. P166 is the correct property for awards. So the final query should correctly retrieve all writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations:**\n   - **Writer** (DBpedia): Mapped to Wikidata's Q36180.\n   - **award** (DBpedia): Mapped to Wikidata's P166.\n   - **Nobel Prize in Literature** (DBpedia): Mapped to Wikidata's Q37922.\n\n2. **Analyze the query pattern:**\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves URIs of type Writer that have received the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - Use `wd:Q36180` for Writer (using `P31` as \"instance of\").\n   - Use `wdt:P166` for the award relation.\n   - Use `wd:Q37922` for Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL query:**\n   - Select distinct items where they are instantiate of Writer and have the award.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n    wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all writers in Wikidata who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n    wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n</sparql>"

It uses the discoverer property (dbo:discoverer) to find the URI associated with Ceres. My goal was to translate this into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nI checked the ER mappings given. The DBpedia resource for Ceres maps to Wikidata's Q596, and the discoverer property in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P61. \n\nNext, I structured the new SPARQL query using Wikidata's prefixes. I used the same basic pattern as the DBpedia query but substituted the relevant entities. So, I replaced the DBpedia URI for Ceres with its Wikidata equivalent and changed the property from dbo:discoverer to wdt:P61.\n\nI made sure to use the correct prefixes in Wikidata, starting with the base URI for the entity and the property. I also checked that I was selecting the discoverer's URI, just as in the original query.\n\nFinally, I validated the query by ensuring that all parts align with how Wikidata structures its data. I confirmed that using wdt:P61 is appropriate for retrieving direct claims without considering qualifiers or references. \n\nThis process gave me the SPARQL query that should effectively retrieve the discoverer of Ceres from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we'll map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata and maintain the query structure.\n\n1. **Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: Ceres (dwarf planet) \u2192 Mapped from DBpedia to Wikidata as `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q596`.\n   - **Relation**: discoverer \u2192 Mapped from DBpedia to Wikidata as `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P61`.\n\n2. **Query Pattern**:\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves the discoverer of Ceres by querying the `dbo:discoverer` property.\n\n3. **Wikidata Syntax**:\n   - Use the prefix `wd` for Wikidata entities.\n   - Use `wdt` for direct property access.\n   - Adjust the property to `wdt:P61` for the discoverer.\n\n4. **Constructed SPARQL Query**:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the discoverer of Ceres (Q596) using the direct property P61 in Wikidata.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

They provided the initial DBpedia query, so I'll use that as a starting point.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations in the DBpedia query. Here, the entities are bandleaders and trumpets, and the relations are occupation and instrument. Looking at the ER2 mapping, I can see that the DBpedia occupation maps to Wikidata's P106, and bandleader has two possible Wikidata IDs: Q5280538 and Q806349. The instrument in DBpedia maps to P1303 in Wikidata, and trumpet maps to Q119621 and Q8338.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the structure of the DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the uri has occupation Bandleader and instrument Trumpet. This suggests I need to find entities in Wikidata that have both properties.\n\nNow, I'll map these to Wikidata. For occupation, it's P106, and for instrument, it's P1303. For the values, I'll include all possible mappings: Q5280538 and Q806349 for bandleaders, and Q119621 or Q8338 for trumpets.\n\nConstructing the query, I'll use the same structure but with Wikidata syntax. I'll use two values for P106 and two for P1303, filtered to ensure they match any of the provided IDs. It's important to use a union in the filter to cover all possible cases without causing errors.\n\nFinally, I'll validate the query to make sure it's correct. I'll check if the syntax is right, and if the properties and values match correctly. I think the query should work as intended, returning all bandleaders who play the trumpet in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s the thought process to create the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n1. **Key Entities and Relations**: The query focuses on bandleaders who play the trumpet, which translates to entities with the occupation \"Bandleader\" and the instrument \"Trumpet\".\n\n2. **Mapping to Wikidata Properties**:\n   - Occupation: `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation>` \u2192 `w:P106 (occupation)`\n   - Bandleader: `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bandleader>` \u2192 `wd:Q5280538` or `wd:Q806349`\n   - Instrument: `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/instrument>` \u2192 `w:P1303 (instrument)`\n   - Trumpet: `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet>` \u2192 `wd:Q119621` or `wd:Q8338`\n\n3. **Query Pattern**: The query filters for entities that have both the occupation and instrument properties matching the specified values.\n\n4. **Constructing the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use a `SELECT DISTINCT` query to retrieve unique results.\n   - Use `?uri` to represent the entity.\n   - Use `VALUES` for occupation and instrument to match multiple possible identifiers.\n\n5. **Final Query**:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE \n{\n  ?uri p:P106 ?bandleader .\n  ?bandleader ps:P106 wd:Q5280538, wd:Q806349 .\n  ?uri p:P1303 ?instrument .\n  ?instrument ps:P1303 wd:Q119621, wd:Q8338 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct URIs for bandleaders who play the trumpet in Wikidata. It accounts for multiple possible identifiers for both \"Bandleader\" and \"Trumpet\" to ensure comprehensive results."

The user wants me to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that shows all basketball players taller than 2 meters, similar to the provided DBpedia query. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations from the original question. The main entities here are \"basketball players\" and their \"height\". The relation is checking if the height is greater than 2 meters.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia ontology for BasketballPlayer maps to Wikidata's Q3665646. So, in Wikidata, the property to represent a basketball player is wdt:P31 with Q3665646. \n\nNext, the height property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P2048. So, I'll use p:P2048 to get the height values in Wikidata. \n\nNow, considering the structure of the original SPARQL query, it selects distinct URIs where each URI is a BasketballPlayer and has a height greater than 2.0. I need to replicate this logic in Wikidata.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is slightly different. Instead of using RDF type (a), we use wdt:P31 for type and p:P2048 for the property along with ps:P2048 to specify the value. Also, units in Wikidata might be in different scales, so I should ensure the height is in meters by using the unit conversion function if necessary, but since the query is about meters, I can stick with > 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select all distinct items where the item is an instance of BasketballPlayer (P31: Q3665646) and their height (P2048) is greater than 2.\n\nI think that's all.

It's looking for films where both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere starred. The query uses dbo:starring for the relationship.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that dbo:starring corresponds to Wikidata's P161. Also, the entities for Film, Julia Roberts, and Richard Gere have their Wikidata IDs.\n\nNow, I need to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, properties use the p: prefix followed by the ID, and values use the ps: prefix for statements and the pq: prefix for qualifiers if needed. Since the DBpedia query uses rdf:type, I need to translate that into Wikidata's type property, which is P31.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select distinct items (films) where they are of type Film, and both starring relationships hold. I'll use wdt:P161 for Julia and Richard.\n\nI should double-check if I need any prefixes, so I'll include the standard ones for RDF, RDFS, XSD, and set xsd:string as the default datatype.

Now, I can write the final SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nLet's construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n1. **Identify key entities and relations**:\n   - **Entities**: Films, Julia Roberts, Richard Gere\n   - **Relations**: Starring\n\n2. **Map entities and relations to Wikidata using ER2**:\n   - **dbo:Film**: Q11424\n   - **dbo:starring**: P161\n   - **Julia Roberts (dbpedia)**: Q40523\n   - **Richard Gere (dbpedia)**: Q48410\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query** using Wikidata syntax:\n\n   The DBpedia query pattern matches films starring both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. We need to replicate this logic in Wikidata.\n\n4. **Final validated SPARQL query for Wikidata**:\n\n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n   PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n   PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n   PREFIX ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\n   PREFIX pq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/>\n\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?item\n   WHERE\n   {\n       ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424.  # Film\n       ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q40523.  # Julia Roberts\n       ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q48410.  # Richard Gere\n   }\n   </sparql>\n   ```\n\n   The query:\n   - Selects distinct films (`?item`).\n   - Ensures the item is a film (`P31: Q11424`).\n   - Ensures the film stars both Julia Roberts (`P161: Q40523`) and Richard Gere (`P161: Q48410`).\n\n   This logic matches the original DBpedia query but is adapted for Wikidata's syntax and properties.\n\n   Final answer:\n   <sparql>\n   PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n   PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n   PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?item\n   WHERE\n   {\n       ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424.  # Film\n       ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q40523.  # Julia Roberts\n       ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q48410.  # Richard Gere\n   }\n   </sparql>"

So, I'll replace \"res:Canada\" with \"wd:Q16\".\n\nThe structure of the DBpedia query is SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Canada dbo:capital ?uri }. In Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different but follows a similar pattern. I'll start by defining the prefixes for Wikidata, which are \"wd\" for entities and \"wdt\" for properties, and \"rdfs\" for labels, although the latter might not be necessary here.\n\nPutting it all together, I want to select the capital (using P36) of Q16 (Canada). So, the SPARQL query becomes SELECT ?capital WHERE { wd:Q16 wdt:P36 ?capital }. This should retrieve the capital of Canada from Wikidata.\n\nLet me double-check if I need any additional parts. The original query doesn't use any labels or additional triples, so a simple triple pattern should suffice. No need for DISTINCT unless necessary, but including it doesn't hurt. However, it's not specified, so I'll include it just in case.\n\nMake sure the syntax is correct, with proper use of prefixes and semicolons where needed. Also, ensure that the variable names make sense. I think that's it. The query should work now.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER mappings.\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relations in the question:**\n   - The country is \"Canada\".\n   - The relation is \"capital\".\n\n2. **Map the entities and relations to Wikidata:**\n   - \"Canada\" in DBpedia maps to \"Q16\" in Wikidata.\n   - \"capital\" in DBpedia maps to \"P36\" in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q16 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the capital of Canada from Wikidata using the mapped entities and relations."

The resource for Cameroon in Wikidata is Q1009, so I'll use wd:Q1009. The relation dbo:capital maps to wdt:P36.\n\nPutting this together, the new query will select the capital using wdt:P36.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to translate the given DBpedia SPARQL query into Wikidata. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the original query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the resource is an Astronaut and has a nationality of either Russia or the Soviet Union. The query uses a UNION to include both nationalities.\n\nNow, I look at the ER2 mappings provided. The DBpedia Astronaut class maps to Wikidata's Q11631. Nationality in DBpedia is P27 in Wikidata. Russia in DBpedia maps to Q2184 and Q159 in Wikidata, and Soviet Union maps to Q15180.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I need to find all entities that are instances of Astronaut (Q11631) and have the nationality property (P27) set to either Russia (Q2184 or Q159) or the Soviet Union (Q15180).\n\nIn SPARQL, Wikidata uses the prefix `wd:` for entities and `p:` for properties. I'll need to structure the query using these prefixes. The query should select distinct items where they have the P27 property with values Q2184, Q159, or Q15180.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, `p:` is used for properties, and the actual value is the property ID with `ps:` for qualifiers. So for the nationality, it's `wdt:P27` which directly takes the value.\n\nI think the correct query would use `VALUES` to specify the nationalities, making it `VALUES ?nationality { wd:Q2184 wd:Q159 wd:Q15180 }`. Then, the graph pattern is `?item wdt:P27 ?nationality`.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P27 ?nationality .\n  VALUES ?nationality { wd:Q2184 wd:Q159 wd:Q15180 }\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11631 .\n}\n\nWait, no, I should check the order. First, it's the type, then the nationality, but in SPARQL, the order doesn't matter as it's a graph pattern. So as long as both triples are present, it should work.\n\nAlternatively, since the main condition is the type, maybe structure it like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11631 ;\n     wdt:P27 ?nationality .\n  VALUES ?nationality { wd:Q2184 wd:Q159 wd:Q15180 }\n}\n\nEither way, both should work, but using the `VALUES` makes it clear and efficient. So I think the first version is better.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss any mappings. The nationality property is correctly mapped to P27, and the entities to their respective Q codes. So yes, the query should correctly retrieve all cosmonauts from Russia or the Soviet Union.\n</think>\n\nTo generate the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings. The query retrieves all astronauts with Russian or Soviet nationality.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - Astronaut: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Astronaut` \u2192 `wd:Q11631`\n   - Nationality: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/nationality` \u2192 `wdt:P27`\n   - Russia: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia` \u2192 `wd:Q2184`, `wd:Q159`\n   - Soviet Union: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union` \u2192 `wd:Q15180`\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Select distinct items where the item is an instance of Astronaut (`wd:Q11631`).\n   - The nationality (`wdt:P27`) should be one of Russia (`wd:Q2184`, `wd:Q159`) or Soviet Union (`wd:Q15180`).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11631 ;\n     wdt:P27 ?nationality .\n  VALUES ?nationality { wd:Q2184 wd:Q159 wd:Q15180 }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all cosmonauts who are either Russian or from the Soviet Union."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original SPARQL query is using DBpedia to find who created Family Guy. The query uses the DBpedia ontology's 'creator' property. I know that in Wikidata, properties are a bit different, often using P followed by a number. From the ER2 mapping provided, I see that 'dbo:creator' maps to 'wdt:P170' in Wikidata. \n\nNext, the entity 'Family Guy' in DBpedia is mapped to 'Q5930' in Wikidata. So, instead of using 'res:Family_Guy', I'll need to use 'wd:Q5930'.\n\nLooking at the structure of the DBpedia query, it's selecting the URI of the creator. In Wikidata queries, the prefix 'wd:' is used for entities, and 'wdt:' for properties. However, when querying for the actual value (like a creator), it's often done using 'ps:' for properties and then the specific property number, but sometimes 'wdt:' is used for direct properties.\n\nI think using 'wdt:P170' makes sense here. So, the query should select the value of 'P170' (creator) for the entity 'Q5930' (Family Guy).\n\nPutting it all together, the query should start with the prefixes for Wikidata, then select the creator where the subject is 'wd:Q5930' and the predicate is 'wdt:P170'. Since we're only interested in one result, we can limit it to 1.\n\nWait, but in the ER2, the 'dbpedia_id' for 'Family_Guy' maps to 'Q5930', so that's correct. And the 'creator' property maps to 'P170'.\n\nSo, the final query would SELECT the value for 'P170' WHERE 'wd:Q5930' has 'wdt:P170' as the predicate. Using 'DISTINCT' isn't necessary here since it's a single value, but it's good practice. Also, adding 'LIMIT 1' ensures we only get one result.\n\nNow, checking the syntax. In Wikidata SPARQL, the query starts with PREFIX definitions for 'wd:', 'wdt:', etc. So I'll include those. The structure is SELECT ?item WHERE { ... }, but in this case, we're looking for a specific entity's property.\n\nWait, maybe I should structure it as SELECT ?creator WHERE { wd:Q5930 wdt:P170 ?creator }, which would return the creator. Since we're looking for the URI, but in this case, the result is an entity, so perhaps using a variable is better.\n\nSo, replacing the variable with ?uri as in the DBpedia query. Therefore, the final query should look something like:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q5930 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\nLIMIT 1\n\nThis should correctly fetch the creator of Family Guy from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis and mapping of entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings, the correct SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed as follows:\n\nThe final SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the creator of \"Family Guy\" by using the Wikidata property P170. The query structure leverages the direct property syntax for efficiency.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q5930 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

Let me start by looking at the information given. \n\nFirst, the original SPARQL query uses DBpedia. It's selecting ?Mexico_City where Mexico City has the populationTotal property. The query is pretty straightforward, using the dbo: and dbr: prefixes which are specific to DBpedia. \n\nNow, since I need to convert this to Wikidata, I should refer to the ER2 mappings provided. From what I see, the DBpedia resource for Mexico City (dbr:Mexico_City) maps to Wikidata's Q1489. Similarly, the populationTotal property (dbo:populationTotal) maps to Wikidata's P1082.\n\nAlright, so in Wikidata, instead of using dbo: and dbr:, we use the WD: and wdt: prefixes. The WD: prefix is for the entity IDs, and wdt: is for the properties. So, Mexico City in Wikidata is WD:Q1489, and the population property is wdt:P1082.\n\nI want to select the population value, which in SPARQL is done with a SELECT clause. So I'll start with SELECT ?populationTotal. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll specify that WD:Q1489 (Mexico City) has the property wdt:P1082 (populationTotal) with the variable ?populationTotal.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look like this:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?populationTotal WHERE {\n  wd:Q1489 wdt:P1082 ?populationTotal\n}\n\nI think that's it. Let me just double-check. The prefixes are correct for Wikidata, and I've properly mapped the entity and property from DBpedia to Wikidata using the ER2 information. The variable names are consistent, so this should return the population of Mexico City.\n</think>\n\nTo find the population of Mexico City using Wikidata, we can construct the following SPARQL query based on the provided mappings and structure:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?populationTotal WHERE {\n  wd:Q1489 wdt:P1082 ?populationTotal\n}\n</sparql>\n\nThis query retrieves the populationTotal value for Mexico City (Q1489) using the P1082 property in Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the natural language question is \"Who created Batman?\" The user has already provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia, which is:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> PREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Batman dbo:creator ?uri }\n\nI need to convert this into a query that works with Wikidata instead. To do this, I have the ER2 mappings that tell me how DBpedia entities and relations map to Wikidata. Let me look at those mappings.\n\nER2 provides two mappings:\n1. For \"Batman\" in DBpedia, the corresponding Wikidata ID is \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2695156\".\n2. For \"creator\" in DBpedia ontology, the corresponding Wikidata property is \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P170\".\n\nSo, the first step is to identify the entities and relations from the original query. The entity is \"Batman\" and the relation is \"creator\". \n\nNext, I analyze the structure of the DBpedia SPARQL query. It selects distinct values for ?uri where the resource \"Batman\" (from DBpedia) has the \"creator\" property. The structure is straightforward\u2014retrieve all entities that are connected to \"Batman\" via the \"creator\" property.\n\nNow, I need to map these to Wikidata. Wikidata uses a different syntax, so I have to adjust the prefixes accordingly. In Wikidata, the common prefix is \"wd\" and \"wds\" for some datasets, but typically, entities start with \"wd:\".\n\nThe equivalent of \"res:Batman\" in DBpedia is \"wd:Q2695156\" in Wikidata. Similarly, \"dbo:creator\" becomes \"wdt:P170\". In Wikidata, the predicate is usually expressed with \"wdt:p\", where \"p\" is the property.\n\nPutting this together, the structure would be SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q2695156 wdt:P170 ?uri }.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes or include them appropriately. In Wikidata, the standard prefix is \"wd:\" for entities and \"wdt:\" for properties, so I'll include the necessary PREFIXES at the beginning of the query.\n\nFinally, I want to ensure that the query is correct by checking the syntax and logic. Since I'm selecting distinct values, I'll use SELECT DISTINCT, and the WHERE clause correctly links Batman to his creator via P170.\n\nPutting it all together, the final SPARQL query for Wikidata should look like this: It includes the prefixes, selects all distinct creators of Batman, and uses the correct Wikidata identifiers and properties.\n\nI think that's all. Now I'll write the complete query.\n</think>\n\nTo find who created Batman using Wikidata, we'll query the Wikidata knowledge graph with the appropriate mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Relation:**\n   - **Entity:** Batman (mapped to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2695156\")\n   - **Relation:** creator (mapped to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P170\")\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata Syntax:**\n   - Use \"wd:\" prefix for entities: `wd:Q2695156`\n   - Use \"wdt:\" prefix for properties: `wdt:P170`\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Select distinct values to avoid duplicates.\n   - The query structure is `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q2695156 wdt:P170 ?uri }`.\n\n4. **Include Prefixes:**\n   - Add `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>` and `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>` for clarity.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    wd:Q2695156 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The original query is for DBpedia and asks for the population of Australia's capital. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the DBpedia query uses the following structure:\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> PREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?num \nWHERE { \n  res:Australia dbo:capital ?x . \n  ?x dbo:populationTotal ?num \n}\n\nSo, the key entities here are \"Australia\" and its capital, and the relations are \"capital\" and \"populationTotal\". \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that:\n- DBpedia's \"Australia\" has Wikidata IDs Q25907685, Q408, Q3960.\n- \"dbo:capital\" maps to Wikidata's P36.\n- \"dbo:populationTotal\" maps to Wikidata's P1082.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query. In Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using prefixes like dbo and res, we use the full URIs or the shortened prefixes, and the query structure might be a bit more straightforward.\n\nThe original query looks for Australia's capital and then gets its population. So, in Wikidata, I should structure it similarly. However, Wikidata sometimes already has the population information at the country level or directly linked to the capital. But assuming I need the structure as the original, I'll proceed.\n\nIn the WHERE clause, I'll replace res:Australia with the Wikidata entity for Australia. Given the multiple options (Q408 is the main one), I'll use wd:Q408. Similarly, dbo:capital becomes p:P36, and dbo:populationTotal becomes p:P1082.\n\nWait, but in Wikidata, for properties, it's usually something like wdt:P36, right? Because p:P36 is for statements, and wdt:P36 is for direct values. So the correct way would be to use wdt:P36 and wdt:P1082.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll structure the query as:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?num\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q408 wdt:P36 ?capital .\n  ?capital wdt:P1082 ?num .\n}\n\nThat should work. It selects the population number where Australia's capital is found, and then the population of that capital is retrieved.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata is structured to find the population of the capital of Australia by mapping the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\n <sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?num WHERE {\n  wd:Q408 wdt:P36 ?capital .\n  ?capital wdt:P1082 ?num .\n}\n</sparql>"

The task is to map these to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that \"dbr:North_Rhine-Westphalia\" maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1198\" and \"dbo:areaTotal\" maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2046\".\n\nTherefore, in Wikidata, the entity is Q1198 and the property is P2046. In Wikidata SPARQL, entities are prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:\". So, putting it together, the query should select the 'tarea' variable where Q1198 has the property P2046.\n\nI should also include a prefix section to make the query cleaner, though in many cases, prefixes can be omitted if using the default ones. Adding prefixes for 'wd' and 'wds' for clarity.\n\nSo the final query should declare the prefixes, select ?tarea, and specify that wd:Q1198 should have the p:P2046 property leading to ?tarea.\n\nLet me make sure that I'm using the correct syntax and that the variables are properly placed. Also, I should check if 'p:P2046' is correct or if it's just 'wdt:P2046' for the property. In Wikidata, the direct property is accessed via 'wdt:', so I'll use that instead.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step process and the resulting SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the entity and relation from the DBpedia query.\n\n- **Entity:** `dbr:North_Rhine-Westphalia`\n- **Relation:** `dbo:areaTotal`\n\n**Step 2:** Map these to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings.\n\n- **Entity Mapping:** `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1198`\n- **Relation Mapping:** `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2046`\n\n**Step 3:** Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax.\n\n- Use the `wd:` prefix for entities and `wdt:` for properties.\n\n**Query Explanation:**\n\n- `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>` and `PREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/>` are optional but included for clarity.\n- `SELECT ?tarea` retrieves the variable containing the total area value.\n- `WHERE { wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea }` specifies that we're looking for the 'areaTotal' property of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n**Resulting SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/>\n\nSELECT ?tarea WHERE {\n  wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down how I approached creating the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given question and context.\n\nFirst, I identified the key components of the original DBpedia query. The question was asking about the budget of \"Pulp Fiction.\" In the DBpedia query, `res:Pulp_Fiction` represented the movie, and `dbo:budget` was the property for the budget. The variable `?n` was used to retrieve the budget's value.\n\nNext, I referred to the ER2 mappings provided to translate these DBpedia resources to their Wikidata counterparts. `res:Pulp_Fiction` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104123`, which is the Wikidata ID for \"Pulp Fiction.\" The `dbo:budget` property from DBpedia maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2769`, which in Wikidata is used to denote a budget.\n\nWith these mappings in hand, I structured the new SPARQL query. In Wikidata, the prefix `wd:` is commonly used for entity IDs, and `p:` is used for property IDs. However, since the exact property can have different forms, I included both `wdt:` for direct property usage and `pq:` for qualifiers if needed, though in this case, a simple `wdt:` should suffice.\n\nI started the query with the standard `PREFIX` declarations for Wikidata, ensuring that `wd` points to the entity namespace and `wdt` to the property namespace. Then, I used `SELECT DISTINCT ?n` to specify that I want unique budget values.\n\nIn the `WHERE` clause, I referenced the Wikidata entity for \"Pulp Fiction\" using `wd:Q104123`, and applied the budget property `wdt:P2769` to retrieve the budget value into the variable `?n`.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure that the logical structure of the query remained consistent with the original DBpedia version, only changing the prefixes and identifiers according to the ER2 mappings. This ensures that the query correctly fetches the budget information from Wikidata instead of DBpedia.\n\nFinally, I validated the query to ensure that all elements align with Wikidata's data model. This included checking that the entity and property identifiers were correct and that the use of `wdt:` was appropriate for direct property retrieval.\n\nPutting it all together, I constructed the SPARQL query that would effectively retrieve the budget of \"Pulp Fiction\" from Wikidata, mirroring the structure and intent of the original DBpedia query but adapted to the Wikidata ontology and syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided DBpedia query, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations**: The key entity is \"Pulp Fiction,\" and the relation is \"budget.\"\n\n2. **Map DBpedia Resources to Wikidata**: Using the ER2 mappings, map the resources from DBpedia to their corresponding Wikidata IDs:\n   - `res:Pulp_Fiction` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104123`\n   - `dbo:budget` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2769`\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL Query**: Use the mapped Wikidata IDs to construct the query. In Wikidata, properties are typically queried using the `wdt:` prefix for direct properties and `pq:` for qualifiers if necessary.\n\nHere's the complete SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?n\nWHERE {\n    wd:Q104123 wdt:P2769 ?n\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original query selects movies starring Jesse Eisenberg using DBpedia's ontology. \n\nFirst, I'll identify the key entities and relations from the DBpedia query. The types and properties used are \"Film\" and \"starring\", and the entity is \"Jesse_Eisenberg\". \n\nNext, I'll refer to the ER2 mappings provided to translate these DBpedia entries to Wikidata. \n- \"Film\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"Q11424\" in Wikidata.\n- \"starring\" maps to \"P161\".\n- \"Jesse_Eisenberg\" is \"Q219512\".\n\nNow, I'll structure the Wikidata query. Instead of using triples like DBpedia, Wikidata uses a query where each triple is a separate statement. \n\nI'll start by defining a variable for the movie URIs. The class for films is \"wd:Q11424\", so I'll use that in the query. The starring property is \"wdt:P161\", which connects the movie to the actor. The actor in this case is \"wd:Q219512\".\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the SELECT statement to retrieve all unique movies. The WHERE clause will include the two conditions: the item is a film and it stars Jesse Eisenberg. \n\nI should also include a SERVICE clause to use the label service for better readability, though it's optional. However, since the original query didn't specify labels, maybe it's better to keep it simple and just fetch the URIs.\n\nFinally, I'll review the query to ensure it correctly maps all elements from DBpedia to Wikidata and that the syntax follows Wikidata's SPARQL conventions.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, let's analyze and map each component from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mappings.\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: `Jesse_Eisenberg` (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesse_Eisenberg) maps to `Q219512` in Wikidata.\n   - **Relation**: `starring` (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring) maps to `P161` in Wikidata.\n   - **Class**: `Film` (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film) maps to `Q11424` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   Using Wikidata's syntax, we translate the DBpedia query into a Wikidata query. In Wikidata, we use the following:\n   - `wd:Q219512` for Jesse Eisenberg\n   - `wdt:P161` for the \"starring\" relation\n   - `wd:Q11424` for films\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P161 wd:Q219512 .\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all items (movies) that are films (`P31` denotes \"instance of\") and star Jesse Eisenberg."

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query into one that works with Wikidata. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original query is asking for all Danish movies. It uses DBpedia's ontology to define a Film and specifies the country as Denmark. The SPARQL query for DBpedia looks like this:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark> }\n\nNow, I need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\nLooking at the ER2 data:\n\n1. The DBpedia Film ontology (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film) maps to Wikidata's Q11424.\n2. The DBpedia country property (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country) maps to Wikidata's P17.\n3. Denmark in DBpedia is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark, which maps to both Q5257925 and Q35 in Wikidata. But since Q35 is the main entity for Denmark, I'll use that.\n\nNext, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, the query syntax uses prefixes like wd: and p:, but since the standard is to use the full IRIs or the prefixes as per the context, I should adjust accordingly.\n\nThe structure in DBpedia is:\n- ?uri is a Film (a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film>)\n- ?uri has country <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark>\n\nIn Wikidata, this translates to:\n- ?uri has the property P17 (country) with the value Q35 (Denmark)\n- Since Wikidata uses instance of (P31) to denote the type, instead of using a rdf:type, the film would be identified by having P31 wd:Q11424 (film).\n\nPutting it all together, the WHERE clause in the SPARQL query should include both conditions: being a film and being from Denmark.\n\nSo, the query should select distinct ?uri where:\n- ?uri p:P31 ?film .\n- ?film ps:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n- ?uri p:P17 ?country .\n- ?country ps:P17 wd:Q35 .\n\nWait, that seems a bit complex with the property paths. Alternatively, using the direct property assignments:\n\n?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n     wdt:P17 wd:Q35 .\n\nThat's a more straightforward way. So the entire query would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n       wdt:P17 wd:Q35 .\n}\n\nWait, but in the original ER2, the country in DBpedia maps to P17 in Wikidata, which is correct. And the Film type is P31 to Q11424. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think this covers mapping both the type (Film) and the country (Denmark) correctly into the Wikidata query. So the final query should look like that.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve all Danish movies from Wikidata, the SPARQL query needs to use the appropriate properties and entities mapped from DBpedia. The key steps involve identifying the film type and country relation in Wikidata.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Relations**:\n   - **Film**: In DBpedia, this is `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film>`, which maps to Wikidata's `wd:Q11424`.\n   - **Country**: The DBpedia property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>` maps to Wikidata's `P17`.\n   - **Denmark**: In DBpedia, this is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark>`, which maps to `wd:Q35` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the Query Structure**:\n   - The query should select all URIs that are of type Film (`P31`) and have the country Denmark (`P17`).\n\n3. **Translate to Wikidata SPARQL Syntax**:\n   - Use `wdt:P31` for \"instance of\" and `wdt:P17` for \"country of\".\n   - Instead of using `a` and `;` as in DBpedia, use semicolons to separate multiple properties.\n\nPutting it all together, the final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n       wdt:P17 wd:Q35 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects all entities in Wikidata that are films and associated with Denmark.\n\n</sparql>\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n       wdt:P17 wd:Q35 .\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that finds the countries the Himalayan mountain system extends to. Let me start by breaking down what I have.\n\nFirst, the original query in DBpedia is SELECTing ?uri WHERE the Himalayas are related to ?uri via the country property. So, the key entities here are \"Himalayas\" and \"country\". \n\nFrom the ER2 mappings, I see that \"Himalayas\" in DBpedia maps to several Wikidata entities: Q105981852, Q26235529, and Q5451. I'm not sure which one is the main one, but maybe Q5451 is the primary entry since it's listed last. \n\nNext, the relation \"country\" in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P17, which is \"country\". So that seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the goal is to find all countries related to the Himalayas. In Wikidata, to get the country, I might need to use a property path or maybeachi statement. But in this case, since P17 is the direct property, I can use it directly.\n\nI think the structure would be to get the entity for the Himalayas, which is Q5451, and then use P17 to find the countries. However, in Wikidata, sometimes properties can be in different directions. I need to make sure whether P17 is the country that the subject is located in. So, using P17 should give me the countries the Himalayas are in.\n\nPutting it all together, I can structure the query to select ?country where wd:Q5451 has P17 leading to ?country. That should give me all the countries the Himalayas extend to.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to prefix the query properly. Wikidata uses the \"wd:\" prefix for entities and \"wdt:\" for properties. So, I'll need to use wd:Q5451 and wdt:P17. \n\nSo the final query would look like this:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE { wd:Q5451 wdt:P17 ?country }.\n\nI should also add a prefix section just in case, but in SPARQL, prefixes can be defined, but in examples, they often are included. So I'll add PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and so on.\n\nI think that should work. It selects all distinct countries that are directly linked via P17 from the Himalayas.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata to determine the countries the Himalayan mountain system extends to is constructed by mapping the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Components:**\n   - **Subject:** Himalayas in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q5451 (primary).\n   - **Predicate:** The relation \"country\" in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P17.\n\n2. **SPARQL Structure:**\n   - **SELECT:** Retrieve distinct countries.\n   - **WHERE Clause:** Use the primary entity of the Himalayas and the country relation in Wikidata.\n\n**Final Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country \nWHERE \n{ \n  wd:Q5451 wdt:P17 ?country \n}\n```"

Let's start by understanding what the original query does.\n\nThe original query is selecting the largest country based on the total area. It uses DBpedia's ontology, so it's querying for entities of type dbo:Country, retrieving their total area, ordering them in descending order, and limiting the result to just the first one.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that dbo:Country in DBpedia maps to Q6256 in Wikidata, and dbo:areaTotal maps to P2046, which is \"area\" in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, entities are identified with a 'Q' followed by a number, like Q6256 for country. Properties start with 'P', so P2046 is the area property. The SPARQL syntax for Wikidata uses prefixes like wd and wdt for the entity and property. Also, to filter for entities that have a certain type, I think we use the 'instance of' property, which is P31.\n\nPutting this together, the query should select the country (wd:Q6256), filter it to be an instance of a country, retrieve the area, order by descending area, and limit to one result.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes in the SPARQL query, like 'PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>' for direct properties and 'PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>' for entities.\n\nWait, the ORDER BY clause needs to use the same variable as the area. So, whatever variable I use to retrieve the area should be the one I use to order by. \n\nI think I have everything. Let me structure it step by step:\n\n1. Select the country and its area.\n2. Use the country instance filter with P31.\n3. Order by area descending.\n4. Limit to one result.\n\nThat should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the largest country by area, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relations**: We map `dbo:Country` to `wd:Q6256` and `dbo:areaTotal` to `wdt:P2046`.\n\n2. **Translate the query structure**: Select the country and its area, filter by country type, order by area descending, and limit results.\n\nHere's the final query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?country ?area \nWHERE \n{\n    ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .\n    ?country wdt:P2046 ?area .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?area)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the largest country by area from Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original question is asking for the alma mater of Angela Merkel, the former Chancellor of Germany.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the DBpedia SPARQL query provided:\n```\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT ?Almamater \nWHERE { \n  dbr:Angela_Merkel dbo:almaMater ?Almamater \n}\n```\nThis query selects the alma mater of Angela Merkel using DBpedia's ontology.\n\nNext, I need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings. From the provided mapping:\n- Angela Merkel in DBpedia is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567` in Wikidata.\n- The property `dbo:almaMater` in DBpedia is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P69` in Wikidata.\n\nNow, in Wikidata, the entity Angela Merkel is referenced as `wd:Q567`, and the property for alma mater is `wdt:P69`.\n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should follow the structure of selecting the alma mater (`?almaMater`) where Angela Merkel (Q567) has the alma mater property (P69) pointing to it.\n\nSo, the query becomes:\n```\nSELECT ?almaMater WHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?almaMater\n}\n```\nThis query uses the correct Wikidata syntax, prefixes, and structure to fetch the required information. I also ensure that the variable name is in lowercase as per common practices, though it's not strictly necessary.\n\nFinally, I validate by checking that all parts are correctly mapped and that the query aligns with how Wikidata stores the data. Since the mappings are direct, there shouldn't be any issues. If there were no direct equivalents, I would look for alternative properties, but in this case, P69 directly maps to alma mater.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations**: The question asks for Angela Merkel's alma mater. In the DBpedia query, this is represented by `dbr:Angela_Merkel` and `dbo:almaMater`.\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata**: Using the ER2 mappings:\n   - `dbr:Angela_Merkel` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567`.\n   - `dbo:almaMater` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P69`.\n\n3. **Construct the Query**: Replace DBpedia prefixes and properties with Wikidata equivalents. Wikidata uses `wdt:` for properties and `wd:` for entities.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?almaMater WHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?almaMater\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I\u2019ve been given a task to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the provided DBpedia (KG1) query. Let me walk through how I would approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking, \"Who created Goofy?\" The corresponding SPARQL query for DBpedia is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goofy> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator> ?uri }\n\nI need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the ER2 mappings provided:\n- The DBpedia resource \"Goofy\" maps to Wikidata's Q111135.\n- The DBpedia property \"creator\" (dbpedia.org/ontology/creator) maps to Wikidata's P170.\n\nSo, the key entities and relations have a one-to-one mapping here.\n\nNext, understanding the structure of the DBpedia query: It's looking for all distinct URIs where Goofy is the subject, and the predicate is creator. The equivalent in Wikidata would involve the same structure but using Wikidata's IRIs.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:' or 'wds:' depending on whether we're using the direct property or a statement. Since P170 is \"creator\", I can use 'wds:p170' in the query.\n\nNow, constructing the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n- The subject is the Wikidata entity for Goofy: wd:Q111135.\n- The predicate is the Wikidata property for creator: wds:p170.\n- The object will be the variable we're binding, let's say ?creator.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct ?creator where the triple ( wd:Q111135, wds:p170, ?creator ) exists.\n\nI should also ensure that the syntax is correct. In Wikidata, using 'wds:' is appropriate for accessing the statement's main value. Also, using DISTINCT ensures we get unique results.\n\nSo, the final query would be:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?creator WHERE { wd:Q111135 wds:p170 ?creator }\n\nI think that covers the mapping correctly. Just to double-check, I can think of it in terms of the original question: who created Goofy. The query is correctly set up to fetch the creator entity linked to Goofy in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings. The process is straightforward as each entity and relation has a direct counterpart in Wikidata.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity in DBpedia:** Goofy (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goofy`)\n   - **Relation in DBpedia:** creator (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator`)\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - **Goofy in DBpedia maps to** `Q111135` in Wikidata.\n   - **Creator in DBpedia maps to** `P170` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use Wikidata's property syntax `p:` or `wds:`. Here, `wds:p170` is appropriate.\n   - Query structure: Select the creator(s) (`?creator`) where `wd:Q111135` is the subject and `wds:p170` is the predicate.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n <sparql> SELECT DISTINCT ?creator WHERE {\n  wd:Q111135 wds:p170 ?creator\n} </sparql> \n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct creators of Goofy from Wikidata."
