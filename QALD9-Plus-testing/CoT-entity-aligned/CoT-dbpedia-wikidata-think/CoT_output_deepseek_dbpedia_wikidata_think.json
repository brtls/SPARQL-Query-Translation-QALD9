Let me start by understanding what the original query is doing. \n\nThe original query is asking for the founder of Penguin Books in DBpedia. It uses the `dbo:founder` property. Now, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that `dbo:founder` in DBpedia corresponds to `P112` in Wikidata. So, I need to use `wdt:P112` in my Wikidata query.\n\nNext, I need to identify the subject, which is Penguin Books. From the ER2 mappings, Penguin Books in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penguin_Books`) maps to two Wikidata entities: `Q1336200` and `Q3374730`. I should include both to cover all possibilities.\n\nThe original query selects `?uri` where Penguin Books have the founder property. So, in Wikidata, I'll structure the query similarly: for each Penguin Books entity, retrieve the value of `P112`. \n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the SPARQL query using the Wikidata prefixes and properties. I'll make sure to include both Penguin Books entities to fetch all possible founders. \n\nSo, my final query will select distinct values where each Penguin Books entity has the `wdt:P112` property, ensuring I get the founder information correctly from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and relationships from DBpedia to their corresponding entries in Wikidata using the provided mappings.\n\nThe DBpedia query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n    res:Penguin_Books dbo:founder ?uri \n}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations in the question:**\n   - **Entity:** Penguin Books\n   - **Relation:** founder\n\n2. **Map the entities and relations to Wikidata using 'er2':**\n   - **Penguin Books:** Mapped to `Q1336200` and `Q3374730` in Wikidata.\n   - **Founder:** Mapped to `P112` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declarations for Wikidata namespaces.\n   - Use `wdt:P112` for the founder relation.\n   - Query for the distinct values of the founder.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    { wd:Q1336200 wdt:P112 ?uri }\n    UNION\n    { wd:Q3374730 wdt:P112 ?uri }\n}\n```\n\nThe above query retrieves the founder of Penguin Books from Wikidata by querying both possible entities (`Q1336200` and `Q3374730`) and their respective `P112` (founder) properties.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    { wd:Q1336200 wdt:P112 ?uri }\n    UNION\n    { wd:Q3374730 wdt:P112 ?uri }\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user generate a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided DBpedia query and mappings. Let me walk through the steps methodically.\n\nFirst, the user\u2019s question is asking which films Stanley Kubrick directed. The original DBpedia SPARQL query is selecting URIs where the director is Stanley Kubrick. The query uses DBpedia\u2019s ontology and resource namespaces. The key entities here are the films (Variables: ?uri), and the relation is \"director\". The specific entity is Stanley Kubrick.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, DBpedia\u2019s \"director\" (dbo:director) maps to Wikidata's P57. Similarly, DBpedia's resource for Stanley Kubrick is mapped to Wikidata's Q2001. So, I need to translate these into Wikidata's property and entity structure.\n\nIn Wikidata, to find the films directed by someone, I would use the property \"director\" (P57), but in reverse. Since we're looking for films where Kubrick is the director, I need to structure the query to find items where P57 points to Q2001.\n\nWikidata uses the prefix 'wd' for entities and 'p' for properties, followed by the property ID and then 'ps' for the statement. So, the triple would be {?film wdt:P57 wd:Q2001}.\n\nI should make sure to use distinct to avoid duplicates and return the film's label for readability. Therefore, the query should select distinct ?film and ?filmLabel, using the rdfs:label for the label.\n\nPutting it all together, the query starts with the prefixes, then the select clause. The where clause includes the triple for the director being Kubrick and the label retrieval. I should also specify the language for the label, probably English.\n\nSo, the final SPARQL query should look like this:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film ?filmLabel\nWHERE {\n    ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q2001.\n    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" }\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nLet me double-check the mappings and syntax. The director property maps to P57, and Stanley Kubrick is Q2001. The query structure correctly fetches films directed by Kubrick and their labels in English. It should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we'll map the entities and relations from the DBpedia query using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n### Key Entities and Relations:\n- **Entity 1**: `Stanley_Kubrick` (director)\n- **Relation**: `director` (dbo:director)\n\n### ER2 Mappings:\n- `dbo:director` \u2192 `P57`\n- `res:Stanley_Kubrick` \u2192 `Q2001`\n\n### SPARQL Query Construction:\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q2001\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Namespaces**: Added `wdt` (Wikidata direct property), `wd` (Wikidata entity), and `rdfs` (RDF schema).\n2. **Query Pattern**: The same as the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's property and entity identifiers.\n3. **Validation**: Ensured that all entities, properties, and relationships align with Wikidata's data model.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q2001\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all films directed by Stanley Kubrick from Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user by creating a SPARQL query for Wikidata to list all the musicals with music by Elton John. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the context provided. The user has already given me a SPARQL query for DBpedia, and now they want the equivalent for Wikidata. The key here is to map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings:\n\n1. The DBpedia ontology for Musical is mapped to Wikidata's Q2743.\n2. The DBpedia property musicBy is mapped to Wikidata's P86.\n3. Elton John's DBpedia resource is mapped to Wikidata's Q2808.\n\nSo, in the DBpedia query, they select all ?uri where ?uri is of type dbo:Musical and has dbo:musicBy res:Elton_John. My task is to translate this into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nI know that in Wikidata, classes (like Musical) are represented as instances of Q entities. So, instead of rdf:type, I should use the property wdt:P31, which is used for \"instance of.\" Therefore, ?uri should be of type wdt:P31 with the value wd:Q2743.\n\nNext, the relation dbo:musicBy in DBpedia is similar to P86 in Wikidata, which stands for \"music by.\" So, I'll use p:P86 and the value wd:Q2808.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select distinct ?uri where ?uri is an instance of Musical (wd:Q2743) and has the music by Elton John (wd:Q2808). \n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct in Wikidata. They use the prefix wdt for statement properties, which directly access the values, and p for qualifiers. Since we just need the main property here, wdt:P31 and p:P86 are appropriate.\n\nSo, the final query should look something like SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q2743 ; p:P86 wd:Q2808 }. Wait, but in SPARQL, when using p and wdt together, you might need to structure it with semicolons or braces correctly.\n\nI think using semicolons to separate the two properties is better, so it would be ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q2743 ; p:P86 wd:Q2808. Also, ensure that the prefixes are correctly defined. \n\nWait, no, in the initial query, they didn't define the prefixes, so maybe I don't need to. But SPARQL requires prefixes, so I should include them. The default prefixes in Wikidata are already handled, so I can just use wdt and p directly.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct query uses SELECT DISTINCT, defines ?uri with both properties, and ensures that the values are correct. I think that's it. Now, let me write it out properly.\n</think>\n\nThe final step is to construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the mappings identified and the logical structure of the DBpedia query.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Identify the entities and relations to be mapped:\n   - `dbo:Musical` is mapped to `wd:Q2743`.\n   - `dbo:musicBy` is mapped to `wdt:P86`.\n   - `res:Elton_John` is mapped to `wd:Q2808`.\n\n2. Analyze the query:\n   - The query selects all distinct URIs of entities that are of type \"Musical\" and have \"music by\" Elton John.\n\n3. Map the entities and relations to Wikidata:\n   - Replace `dbo:Musical` with `wd:Q2743`.\n   - Replace `dbo:musicBy` with `p:P86`.\n   - Replace `res:Elton_John` with `wd:Q2808`.\n\n4. Construct the Wikidata SPARQL query:\n   - Use the same query pattern but with the mapped entities and relations.\n\nHere is the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q2743 ;\n          p:P86 wd:Q2808 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The original query is asking for the developers of Skype.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the existing DBpedia query does. It uses the prefixes dbo, res, and rdfs. The query selects the URI where 'Skype' has the 'developer' property. So, it's looking for all entities that are developers of Skype.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that the Skype entity in DBpedia is mapped to Q40984 in Wikidata, and the 'developer' property in DBpedia is mapped to P178 in Wikidata. So, I need to replace these with the corresponding Wikidata identifiers.\n\nIn Wikidata, the way to write SPARQL queries is a bit different. Instead of using the res prefix for the main entity, we typically use the entity's IRI directly. So, res:Skype in DBpedia becomes <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q40984> in Wikidata.\n\nFor the developer property, in DBpedia it's dbo:developer, but in Wikidata, it's P178. However, in Wikidata SPARQL, properties are referenced as p:P178, and then we specify the actual property using ps:P178 for the main property. Wait, no, that's for statements with qualifiers. For a simple triple, maybe I just need to use the property as p:P178 followed by the value.\n\nPutting this together, the query should select the value where Skype (Q40984) has a 'developer' relation (P178). So, I need to structure it as a triple: <Q40984> p:P178 ?developer.\n\nWait, I'm remembering that in Wikidata SPARQL, property usages are a bit more involved. Each property statement is made up of a main part and a qualifier. So, to just get the value, I think I should use a construct where the predicate is p:P178 and the object is ?developer.\n\nAlso, in Wikidata, to get the labels or names, we often use rdfs:label, but in this case, the original query was about getting the URIs. So, maybe we don't need to filter for labels, but just return the URIs of the developers.\n\nPutting this all together, the SPARQL query should query the Wikidata endpoint, use the Skype entity, link it via p:P178 to the developer's URI, and select that URI.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure about the correct syntax. I think in Wikidata, to retrieve statements, you use the property path like <Q40984> p:P178 ?developer. But sometimes you might need to include the statement's subject, object, etc., but in this case, since it's a simple triple, it should suffice.\n\nSo, the prefixes aren't used in the same way. Instead, the query will directly reference the entities and properties via their IRIs. So, the FROM clause might not be necessary because we're querying the default endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the final query should look like selecting ?developer where Q40984 has P178 as ?developer. That should give me all the developers of Skype in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their corresponding Wikidata identifiers using the provided 'er2' mappings. The query identifies the developers of Skype by selecting the 'P178' (developer) property of the 'Q40984' (Skype) entity.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?developer \nWHERE {\n    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q40984> wdt:P178 ?developer .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that will list all the soccer clubs playing in the Bundesliga, similar to what the given DBpedia query does. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the original DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct URIs where each URI is a SoccerClub and is part of the Bundesliga league. In SPARQL terms, it's looking for entities that have the type SoccerClub and are in the league Bundesliga.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that:\n- DBpedia's SoccerClub ontology maps to Wikidata's Q476028.\n- DBpedia's league ontology maps to Wikidata's P118.\n- DBpedia's Bundesliga resource maps to Wikidata's Q82595.\n\nSo, in Wikidata terms, I need to find all items that are instances of \"soccer club\" (which is Q476028), and have the \"league\" (P118) set to \"Bundesliga\" (Q82595).\n\nNext, I need to structure this into a SPARQL query for Wikidata. Wikidata uses the PREFIX syntax for namespaces, usually with prefixes like wdt and p. So, I would use wdt:P118 because it's a statement about the property, and p:P118/psn for the property's value in case of qualifications, but since in this case, it's a direct statement, maybe just using wdt:P118 would suffice.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct items where the item has the P118 property with the object Q82595, and is an instance of Q476028. Wait, but in Wikidata, the way to denote an instance is using the P31 property. So, WDQS requires that I state the instance of relationship explicitly.\n\nSo, the query would involve two triples: one for being an instance of a soccer club (P31 Q476028), and another for participating in the Bundesliga league (P118 Q82595).\n\nLet me think if I have that right. So, in Wikidata SPARQL, it should be something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ;\n         wdt:P118 wd:Q82595 .\n}\n\nYes, that makes sense. P31 is \"instance of\", so ?item is an instance of Q476028 (soccer club), and participates in Q82595 (Bundesliga) via P118 (league).\n\nI should double-check if P118 is indeed the correct property for \"league\". From the ER2 mappings, it seems that DBpedia's league is mapped to P118 in Wikidata. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlso, in Wikidata, the full IRIs use the wdt: prefix for direct property values, so using wdt:P31 and wdt:P118 is appropriate here.\n\nI believe that's the correct approach. So, the final query would be as constructed.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the list of soccer clubs in the Bundesliga, we translate the DBpedia query using the provided ER2 mappings. The key entities and relations are mapped to their Wikidata counterparts, focusing on the instance of a soccer club and participation in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe final query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ;\n         wdt:P118 wd:Q82595 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves all items in Wikidata that are instances of a soccer club and play in the Bundesliga league.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ;\n         wdt:P118 wd:Q82595 .\n}\n</sparql>"

The original question is asking how many films Leonardo DiCaprio has starred in. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the DBpedia SPARQL query provided. It selects the count of distinct film URIs where each film is starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The structure is straightforward: it's looking for films and their starring relation to DiCaprio.\n\nNext, I'll refer to the ER2 mappings to translate each part of the DBpedia query into Wikidata equivalents. The DBpedia ontology for Film is mapped to Wikidata's Q11424. The starring relation is mapped to P161. Lastly, Leonardo DiCaprio's DBpedia resource maps to Q38111 in Wikidata.\n\nNow, I'll think about how SPARQL works in Wikidata. Instead of using RDF type like 'a' in DBpedia, Wikidata uses the 'wdt:' prefix for direct property claims. So, for the entity type, I'll use wdt:P31 to state that the item is an instance of Film.\n\nThe starring relation is a bit different because in Wikidata, P161 (cast member) is typically used in a qualifier of the work. So, for each film, we need to check if Leonardo DiCaprio is listed as a cast member.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to count the number of items that are films and have Leonardo DiCaprio as a cast member.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let's start by breaking down what I have here.\n\nThe original query is asking when Olof Palme was shot. The DBpedia SPARQL query is selecting the death date of Olof Palme. It's using the DBpedia ontology's deathDate property. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that Olof Palme's DBpedia resource maps to Wikidata's Q53713, and the deathDate property maps to Wikidata's P570. So that's the key info I need to translate.\n\nNow, I need to structure this in Wikidata's SPARQL syntax. In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:', and properties are handled a bit differently, often using 'p:' and 'ps:' for qualifiers. So instead of just the property, we might refer to 'ps:570' for the actual statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the death date where the subject is Olof Palme (wd:Q53713) and the predicate is the death date property (ps:570). I think the correct syntax would involve using a prefix for WD and then querying the death date.\n\nWait, I should double-check how property statements are structured in Wikidata SPARQL. Typically, it's something like ?item wds:ps wd:P570 ?value, where ?item is the entity. So in this case, Olof Palme's item is wd:Q53713, so the query would look for that item's statement on P570.\n\nSo the final query should select the death date ?date where wd:Q53713 has the property ps:570 leading to ?date. Also, including the prefix for wikibase to ensure everything is properly referenced.\n\nI should make sure the syntax is correct, including the use of 'p:' for the property and 'ps:' for the statement. Also, since dates in Wikidata can be represented as xsd:date, I might not need to specify a datatype, but it's good to be aware.\n\nI think that's it. The query should effectively fetch the death date of Olof Palme from Wikidata using the correct mappings and syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the death date of Olof Palme, we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata and adjust the query syntax accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Olof Palme (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olof_Palme`)\n   - **Relation:** deathDate (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathDate`)\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - Olof Palme in DBpedia maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q53713` in Wikidata.\n   - deathDate in DBpedia maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P570` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Understand the Query Structure:**\n   - The query retrieves the death date of Olof Palme using the deathDate property.\n\n4. **Construct the Wikidata Query:**\n   - Use Wikidata's SPARQL syntax.\n   - Use `p:` and `ps:` prefixes for properties.\n   - The query pattern in Wikidata is `SELECT ?date WHERE { wd:Q53713 p:P570 ?statement . ?statement ps:P570 ?date }`.\n\n5. **Validate the Query:**\n   - Ensure the entities and properties align with Wikidata's data model.\n   - Verify that `P570` is used correctly for dates.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?date WHERE {\n    wd:Q53713 p:P570 ?statement .\n    ?statement ps:P570 ?date .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The original query is for DBpedia and it's selecting movies that star both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The query uses the 'starring' property for both actors.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER2 mappings provided. The DBpedia 'starring' property corresponds to Wikidata's P161. Elizabeth Taylor in DBpedia maps to Q34851 in Wikidata, and Richard Burton maps to Q151973.\n\nNext, I'll analyze how the original SPARQL query is structured. It selects distinct URIs where each URI has both 'starring' properties for Taylor and Burton.\n\nNow, I'll convert this to Wikidata syntax. Instead of DBpedia's ontology and resource URIs, I'll use Wikidata's properties and entity identifiers. So, the 'starring' property becomes P161, and the actors become Q34851 and Q151973.\n\nI should also remember that in Wikidata, the query syntax uses prefixes like 'wd' for entities and 'p' for properties. So, I'll structure the query to use these prefixes correctly.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will select distinct items where each item is associated with both Taylor and Burton via the 'starring' property. I'll make sure to format the SPARQL correctly, using 'WHERE' and the appropriate filters.\n\nI should double-check to ensure all mappings are correctly applied and that there are no syntax errors. Once everything looks good, the final SPARQL query should effectively retrieve the desired information from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nHere is the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n    ?item p:P161 ?statement_1 .\n    ?statement_1 ps:P161 wd:Q34851 .\n    ?item p:P161 ?statement_2 .\n    ?statement_2 ps:P161 wd:Q151973 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query works by:\n1. Using the P161 property (equivalent to DBpedia's \"starring\")\n2. Looking for items that have both Elizabeth Taylor (Q34851) and Richard Burton (Q151973) as actors\n3. Using the distinct keyword to ensure unique results\n4. Using the ps: and p: prefixes to navigate the Wikidata statement structure\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n    ?item p:P161 ?statement_1 .\n    ?statement_1 ps:P161 wd:Q34851 .\n    ?item p:P161 ?statement_2 .\n    ?statement_2 ps:P161 wd:Q151973 .\n}\n</sparql>"

It's selecting the URI of the developer of Minecraft using DBpedia's ontology.\n\nThe original query is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minecraft> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/developer> ?uri }\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER mappings provided. The DBpedia resource for Minecraft maps to Wikidata's Q49740. The developer relation in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P178.\n\nNow, in Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:', but in SPARQL, we use the full IRIs or the prefixed names if available. The main entity is Minecraft, so in Wikidata, it's wd:Q49740. The property for developer is wdt:P178.\n\nSo the structure should be similar: starting from the Minecraft entity, traverse the developer property to get the URI.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the developer's URI where Minecraft is the subject and developer is the predicate.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. Wikidata uses 'wd:' for entities and 'wdt:' for properties. The WHERE clause would then be { wd:Q49740 wdt:P178 ?uri }.\n\nSo the final SPARQL query for Wikidata should be selecting distinct ?uri where Minecraft (wd:Q49740) has the developer property (wdt:P178) pointing to ?uri.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the Wikidata SPARQL query, we identify that Minecraft maps to Q49740 and the developer relation maps to P178 in Wikidata.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the SPARQL query for Wikidata to answer the question: \"For which label did Elvis record his first album?\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query, it's selecting the record label of Elvis's first album. The DBpedia prefixes are dbo, res, and rdf. The query filters for albums by Elvis Presley, orders them by release date, and limits the result to the first one.\n\nNow, I need to map this to Wikidata using the ER2 provided. Let's see:\n\n- The DBpedia ontology for Album is mapped to Wikidata's Q482994.\n- The artist property is P175 in Wikidata.\n- Elvis Presley is Q303.\n- Release date is P577.\n- Record label is P264.\n\nSo, translating the DBpedia query to Wikidata, I'll use the WD and wdt prefixes instead. The entity for Elvis is Q303, and the record label is P264.\n\nI should structure the query similarly: select the record label (P264) where the item is an album (Q482994), the artist is Elvis (Q303), and order by release date (P577). Then, limit to the first result.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look something like selecting ?recordLabel where the item has P31 to Q482994, P175 to Q303, and P577 for ordering, then get the P264 value. Make sure to order by ?releaseDate and limit to 1.\n\nI should check the syntax to ensure it's correct for Wikidata, using the right prefixes and ensuring all variables are correctly used. I think that's all; let me write the final query.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings and maintain the query structure.\n\nHere's the step-by-step transformation:\n\n1. Map `dbo:Album` to `wd:Q482994`\n2. Map `dbo:artist` to `wdt:P175`\n3. Map `res:Elvis_Presley` to `wd:Q303`\n4. Map `dbo:releaseDate` to `wdt:P577`\n5. Map `dbo:recordLabel` to `wdt:P264`\n\nThe resulting SPARQL query retrieves the first album's label by Elvis Presley, ordered by release date.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?recordLabel \nWHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ;\n         wdt:P175 wd:Q303 ;\n         wdt:P577 ?releaseDate ;\n         wdt:P264 ?recordLabel .\n}\nORDER BY ASC(?releaseDate)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThe query selects the record label (`P264`) for the earliest album (`ordered by release date`) by Elvis Presley (`P175`), ensuring it correctly retrieves the desired information from Wikidata."

Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key entities and relations in the DBpedia query. The entity is \"Toy Story,\" and the relation is \"runtime.\" Looking at the ER2 mappings, I see that \"Toy Story\" in DBpedia maps to \"Q171048\" in Wikidata, and \"runtime\" maps to property \"P2047.\"\n\nNext, I analyze the structure of the DBpedia SPARQL query. It selects the runtime where the resource is \"Toy_Story\" and uses the \"dbo:runtime\" property. In Wikidata, resource IDs start with \"wd:\" and properties with \"wdt:\". So, \"Q171048\" becomes \"wd:Q171048\" and \"P2047\" becomes \"wdt:P2047.\"\n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. It should select \"?runtime\" where \"wd:Q171048\" has \"wdt:P2047\" as \"?runtime.\" Using the same structure as the DBpedia query but replacing the prefixes and syntax accordingly.\n\nI should also ensure that the query is valid by checking if it aligns with Wikidata's data model. Since P2047 is the correct property for runtime, the mapping seems accurate. There\u2019s no need for additional filters or changes.\n\nFinally, I'll write the SPARQL query, making sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax for Wikidata. I'll enclose it within the required tags as specified.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first identify the key entities and relations in the original DBpedia query. The entity is \"Toy Story,\" and the relation is \"runtime.\" Using the ER2 mappings, we map these to their equivalents in Wikidata.\n\nThe DBpedia SPARQL query pattern is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?runtime WHERE {\n    res:Toy_Story dbo:runtime ?runtime\n}\n```\n\nMapping these to Wikidata, the resource \"Toy Story\" becomes `wd:Q171048` and the property \"runtime\" becomes `wdt:P2047`.\n\nConstructing the SPARQL query for Wikidata while maintaining the same logical structure:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?runtime WHERE {\n    wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime\n}\n```\n\nAfter validating, the final Wikidata SPARQL query is:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?runtime WHERE {\n    wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given question and mappings. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking for a list of all trumpet players who were bandleaders. The provided DBpedia SPARQL query uses specific prefixes and properties to retrieve this information.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia properties and resources have corresponding Wikidata entities. For example, the DBpedia 'occupation' is mapped to Wikidata's P106. Similarly, 'Bandleader' in DBpedia is linked to two Wikidata entities, Q5280538 and Q806349. The 'instrument' in DBpedia maps to P1303, and 'Trumpet' is associated with Q119621 and Q8338.\n\nI need to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata syntax. The original query binds ?uri to elements that have occupation Bandleader and instrument Trumpet. In Wikidata, this translates to using properties like 'occupation' (P106) and 'instrument' (P1303) with their respective entities.\n\nSo, the structure of the new query should select distinct ?uri where the uri has both the occupation and instrument properties, using the mapped Wikidata IDs. I need to make sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax, like 'wd' for Wikidata entities and 'p' or 'ps' for properties.\n\nI also need to handle the two possible entities for Bandleader, so I might use the 'VALUES' clause to include both. Alternatively, using a UNION might be another approach, but VALUES seems cleaner here.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct ?uri where they have P106 with either Q5280538 or Q806349, and P1303 with either Q119621 or Q8338. I'll structure it with the appropriate filters or values to match all conditions.\n\nFinally, I should validate the query to ensure it follows Wikidata's syntax and that all the mappings are correctly applied.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, I'll translate the DBpedia query using the provided mappings. Here's how we do it:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**: The question involves entities like 'bandleader' and 'trumpet', and the relations 'occupation' and 'instrument'.\n\n2. **Map from DBpedia to Wikidata**: Using the ER2 mappings:\n   - `dbo:occupation` \u2192 `wdt:P106`\n   - `res:Bandleader` \u2192 `wd:Q5280538`, `wd:Q806349`\n   - `dbo:instrument` \u2192 `wdt:P1303`\n   - `res:Trumpet` \u2192 `wd:Q119621`, `wd:Q8338`\n\n3. **Construct the Query**: We'll select all URIs `?uri` that have both the occupation and instrument properties mapped to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n   ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538 ;\n        wdt:P106 wd:Q806349 ;\n        wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621 ;\n        wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all entities in Wikidata that are both bandleaders and trumpet players."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to determine the birth year of Rachel Stevens. Let me go through the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, the original query is for DBpedia, so I need to translate that to Wikidata. The DBpedia query is selecting the birthYear of Rachel Stevens. From the ER2 mappings, I can see that 'dbo:birthYear' maps to 'wdt:P569' in Wikidata, which represents the birth date.\n\nNext, the entity 'Rachel Stevens' in DBpedia is mapped to 'Q241665' in Wikidata. So in Wikidata, I'll use 'wd:Q241665' as the subject.\n\nThe predicate in the query should be 'wdt:P569' since that's the direct equivalent of 'dbo:birthYear'.\n\nI should also declare namespaces for Wikidata. Typically, 'wd' is for entities and 'wdt' for properties. Sometimes, people use 'wds' for statements, but in this case, since we're directly accessing the property, I'll stick with 'wdt'.\n\nThe query structure is straightforward: SELECT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?uri }\n\nWait, does Wikidata handle the variable directly like that? Yes, I think so. So putting it all together, the prefixes are necessary, so I'll include them at the beginning. Then, the SELECT statement remains the same, retrieving the ?uri variable which holds the birth year.\n\nI don't see any need for additional triples since the birth date is a single property. But I should remember that sometimes Wikidata might have more detailed information, like precision or qualifiers, but for this query, we're just retrieving the year.\n\nSo, the final query should look like this, with the prefixes declared and the correct subject and predicate used. I think that's everything needed. Time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first identify the entities and relations from the DBpedia query. In this case, the entity is \"Rachel Stevens\" and the relation is \"birthYear.\" Using the provided ER2 mappings, we map \"Rachel Stevens\" to its Wikidata identifier and \"birthYear\" to the corresponding Wikidata property.\n\nWe then analyze the DBpedia SPARQL query to understand its structure, which retrieves the birth year of Rachel Stevens. Finally, we construct the equivalent Wikidata SPARQL query.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q241665 wdt:P569 ?uri\n}\n```"

The user has provided a question, \"What is the most frequent cause of death?\" along with a SPARQL query for DBpedia. Their goal is to create a similar SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original DBpedia query. It's selecting the most frequent death cause by counting the number of distinct URIs. The query uses `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathCause>` as the property.\n\nNext, I look at the ER2 mappings provided. The DBpedia property has a corresponding Wikidata ID, `P509`, which stands for \"cause of death.\" So, the property in Wikidata will be `wdt:P509`.\n\nNow, considering Wikidata's syntax, I know that the prefix `wd:` is used for entities, and `wdt:` for properties. The structure of the query in Wikidata will involve counting how many times each cause of death (as an object) is associated with entities.\n\nI should also think about the differences between SPARQL in DBpedia and Wikidata. Wikidata uses RDF/SPARQL with its own prefixes and syntax. The `ASK` keyword isn't needed here since we're selecting data. I need to count the number of distinct subjects that have each cause of death.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct a query that selects the cause of death and counts how many times each occurs. Sorting by the count in descending order and limiting the result to the top one will give the most frequent cause. \n\nI also need to ensure that I'm using the correct prefixes and that the syntax aligns with what Wikidata expects. Testing the query would be the next step to confirm it works correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that aligns with the DBpedia (KG1) query, we first map the properties and adjust the query syntax accordingly.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?x \nWHERE \n{\n  ?uri wdt:P509 ?x .\n}\nGROUP BY ?x\nORDER BY DESC(COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri))\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the most frequent cause of death in Wikidata by counting the occurrences of each cause associated with entities."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata that answers the question \"How high is the Yokohama Marine Tower?\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the original question was answered using a SPARQL query on DBpedia. The DBpedia query uses the dbo:height property. So, I need to find the equivalent property in Wikidata. Looking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that dbo:height maps to P2048 in Wikidata. That makes sense because P2048 represents height in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I look at the entity mappings. The entity \"res:Yokohama_Marine_Tower\" from DBpedia maps to \"Q1207989\" in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, I'll use Q1207989 to refer to the Yokohama Marine Tower.\n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. The structure should be similar to the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's syntax and identifiers. Instead of PREFIX dbo: and res:, I'll use the necessary prefixes for Wikidata, but since it's often implied, I can omit them if necessary.\n\nIn SPARQL, retrieving the height would involve selecting the property P2048 where the subject is Q1207989. So, I'll write the query as SELECT DISTINCT ?num WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1207989> wdt:P2048 ?num }. \n\nWait, I need to make sure about the prefixes. In Wikidata, entities are usually referenced with their full URIs, but sometimes people use prefix wd: for entities and p: or wdtn: for properties. Let me double-check that. Actually, in Wikidata, properties can be referred using wdt: as the prefix. So, P2048 would be wdt:P2048.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the distinct values where the subject is Q1207989 and the predicate is P2048. So, the final query should be something like:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?num WHERE {\n  <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1207989> wdt:P2048 ?num\n}\n\nI should verify if I need to include any other prefixes or if the query can be simplified. In some cases, the full URI for the entity isn't necessary if we use the correct prefixes, but to be precise, I'll include it as <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1207989>.\n\nI think this query should correctly retrieve the height of the Yokohama Marine Tower from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query to retrieve the height of the Yokohama Marine Tower from Wikidata is constructed by mapping the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents. \n\n<'sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?num WHERE {\n  <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1207989> wdt:P2048 ?num\n}\n</sparql>"

My task is to translate this query into one that works with Wikidata. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations from the original question. The main entities are \"Mountain\" and \"Italy,\" and the relation is about location. The query also involves elevation. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia ontology classes and properties are mapped to their equivalents in Wikidata. So, \"dbo:Mountain\" maps to \"wd:Q8502\", which is Wikidata's \"mountain\" class. The \"locatedInArea\" property maps to \"wdt:P131\", and \"elevation\" maps to \"wdt:P2044\". The resource for Italy, \"res:Italy\", maps to \"wd:Q38\".\n\nNow, I need to understand the structure of the DBpedia query. It selects a URI where the URI is a Mountain, located in Italy, and has some elevation. The results are ordered by elevation in descending order, limited to the top one, which effectively gives the highest mountain.\n\nTo construct the Wikidata query, I'll use the mappings. The class is straightforward, using \"wd:Q8502\". The location uses the \"P131\" property pointing to \"wd:Q38\" for Italy. The elevation is retrieved using \"P2044\". \n\nI should also note that in Wikidata, the \"dxa\" extension allows us to get the maximum value directly, which simplifies the query. Instead of ordering and limiting, I can use `MAX(?elevation)` and filter on the mountain resource to get the desired result.\n\nI should ensure that the syntax is correct for Wikidata, using \"wdt\" for property types and \"wd\" for entities. Putting it all together, the query should select the maximum elevation mountain located in Italy.\n</think>\n\nLet's construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), following the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relations**:\n   - \"Mountain\"\n   - \"locatedInArea\"\n   - \"Italy\"\n   - \"elevation\"\n\n2. **Map them to Wikidata using ER2**:\n   - \"dbo:Mountain\" maps to \"wd:Q8502\"\n   - \"dbo:locatedInArea\" maps to \"wdt:P131\"\n   - \"res:Italy\" maps to \"wd:Q38\"\n   - \"dbo:elevation\" maps to \"wdt:P2044\"\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata**:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?uri ?uriLabel MAX(?elevation) AS ?maxElevation\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502;\n       wdt:P131 wd:Q38;\n       wdt:P2044 ?elevation.\n  SERVICE wikibase:label {\n    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\".\n  }\n}\nGROUP BY ?uri\nORDER BY DESC(?maxElevation)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

The ER2 mapping shows that dbo:doctoralAdvisor corresponds to Wikidata's P184, which is 'doctoral advisor'.

So, I need to construct a query that asks for the value of P184 for Q937.\n\nI remember that in Wikidata, you can use the 'wd' prefix for entities and 'p' and 'ps' for properties. So, the query will start with PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> for direct properties.\n\nThe structure should be: SELECT ?item WHERE { wd:Q937 wdt:P184 ?item }.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I'm supposed to help the user by explaining how I arrived at the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the natural language question: \"Who has Tom Cruise been married to?\" This is asking for Tom Cruise's spouses, so I need to identify the relevant entities and relationships in the Wikidata knowledge graph.\n\nThe original SPARQL query on DBpedia is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise> }\n\nBreaking this down, it's looking for all URIs (?uri) where the relationship 'spouse' exists between that URI and Tom Cruise. So, the relationship is 'spouse' and the target is Tom Cruise.\n\nNow, I refer to the ER2 mapping provided. It shows that the DBpedia spouse property (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse) maps to Wikidata's P26 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P26), which is 'spouse'. Similarly, Tom Cruise in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise) maps to Wikidata's Q37079.\n\nSo, I need to construct a similar query in Wikidata. In Wikidata, the structure is a bit different. Instead of using a predicate directly, we use triples with the subject, predicate, and object. Since we're looking for spouses of Tom Cruise, the structure would be Tom Cruise -> P26 -> ?item. \n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query should select distinct ?item where Tom Cruise (wd:Q37079) is connected via P26 (wdt:P26) to ?item. So, the query becomes:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE { wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item }\n\nThis should retrieve all the items (spouses) linked to Tom Cruise via the spouse relationship in Wikidata. I double-check to make sure the syntax is correct and that I'm using the right prefixes (wd and wdt) for accessing Wikidata entities and statements. \n\nFinally, I ensure that the query is correctly enclosed within the <sparql> tags as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we map the entities and relationships using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relationships**:\n    - The relationship in the query is `spouse` (from DBpedia ontology).\n    - The entity is `Tom_Cruise` (from DBpedia resource).\n\n2. **Map these using ER2**:\n    - `spouse` maps to `P26` in Wikidata.\n    - `Tom_Cruise` maps to `Q37079` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL query**:\n    - Use the Wikidata entity `wd:Q37079` for Tom Cruise.\n    - Use `wdt:P26` for the spouse relationship.\n\n4. **Form the query**:\n    - The query retrieves all items connected via `P26` (spouse) from Tom Cruise.\n\n**SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item\n}\n```\n\nThis query fetches all entities (?item) that are spouses of Tom Cruise (wd:Q37079) in Wikidata.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?item\n}\n</sparql>"

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original DBpedia query uses `dbo:populationTotal` to get the population. From the ER2 mappings, I see that `dbo:populationTotal` corresponds to `P1082` in Wikidata. So, I need to use that property.\n\nNext, the entity for Eurasia in DBpedia is mapped to `Q5401` in Wikidata. So, I'll replace `res:Eurasia` with `wd:Q5401`.\n\nThe original query is `SELECT DISTINCT ?population WHERE { res:Eurasia dbo:populationTotal ?population }`. Translating that into Wikidata's syntax, I would use `p:P1082` to access the property, and since I need the specific value, I should use `ps:P1082` for the main statement. Also, including `pq:P582` might be helpful to get the end time if the population figure has a time scope, but maybe it's optional depending on the data.\n\nPutting it all together, I start with the prefixes for Wikidata, then specify the variables I want, where `?item` is Eurasia, and `?population` holds the value. I also include a filter to ensure I'm getting a valid quantity.\n\nSo the query becomes selecting `?item`, `?population`, and optional `?populationEnd`, where `?item` is `wd:Q5401`, has the population property `P1082`, and possibly an end time. The filter ensures `?population` is a valid number.\n\nI think that's all. Now I'll write the SPARQL query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo find the population of Eurasia using Wikidata, we translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax, mapping entities and properties accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Eurasia** in DBpedia (`res:Eurasia`) maps to Wikidata's `Q5401`.\n   - **Population Total** in DBpedia (`dbo:populationTotal`) maps to Wikidata's `P1082`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `wd:Q5401` for Eurasia.\n   - Use `p:P1082` and `ps:P1082` to access the population property and its value.\n   - Optionally, include `pq:P582` to capture the end time if the population figure is time-bound.\n\n3. **Final Query Structure:**\n   - Select `?item`, `?population`, and optionally `?populationEnd`.\n   - Use a filter to ensure `?population` is a quantity.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?population ?populationEnd\nWHERE {\n  ?item wd:P31 wd:Q5107 .\n  ?item p:P1082 ?populationStatement .\n  ?populationStatement ps:P1082 ?population .\n  ?populationStatement pq:P582 ?populationEnd .\n  FILTER(DATATYPE(?population) = <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>)\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the population of Eurasia from Wikidata, including the end time for the population data."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to help the user create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the original query in DBpedia is asking for John Adams's birth date. The SPARQL query uses the dbo:birthDate property. I remember that in Wikidata, properties are denoted with a 'P' followed by a number, and items with a 'Q' followed by a number. So, I need to map the DBpedia entities to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia resource for John Adams is mapped to Wikidata's Q11806. That\u2019s straightforward. Next, the dbo:birthDate property in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P569. So, I can substitute these directly.\n\nNow, considering the structure of SPARQL queries in Wikidata, the prefixes will change. Instead of using dbpedia.org, it'll be wikidata.org. The query pattern should remain similar: select the variable (date) where the resource has the property with that variable. So, I'll structure it as SELECT ?date WHERE { res:John_Adams wdt:P569 ?date }.\n\nWait, I should double-check if wdt:P569 is the correct predicate. Wikidata uses wdt: for direct property access, so that's right. Also, since the query is selecting a date, it should return a literal, which is fine.\n\nI don't think there are any issues with this mapping. So, the final query should use the Wikidata resources and properties correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), we first identify the key entities and relations in the question and map them using the provided ER2 mappings. Then, we adapt the query structure to Wikidata's syntax. Finally, we ensure the query is valid and provides the required information.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Identify key entities and relations:\n   - Entity: John Adams\n   - Relation: birth date\n\n2. Map DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata:\n   - DBpedia: `res:John_Adams` \u2192 Wikidata: `wd:Q11806`\n   - DBpedia: `dbo:birthDate` \u2192 Wikidata: `wdt:P569`\n\n3. Construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q11806 wdt:P569 ?date\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

It uses the prefixes dbo and dbr to select the population total of the European Union. So, the query is asking for the populationTotal property of the European_Union resource.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings, I see that dbr:European_Union maps to wikidata:Q458. The populationTotal property in DBpedia, which is dbo:populationTotal, maps to wikidata:P1082. So, in Wikidata, the European Union is identified as Q458, and the population property is P1082.\n\nI should structure the Wikidata query similarly. Instead of using the dbo and dbr prefixes, I'll need to use the Wikidata prefixes. In Wikidata, the common prefix is wd for entities and p for properties, but when writing the actual SPARQL, you can use the full URIs or define a prefix if needed.\n\nSo, the query should select the population total where the subject is the European Union (Q458) and the predicate is population (P1082). The object will be the value we're looking for.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should retrieve the population total of the European Union using the corresponding Wikidata identifiers.

I'll structure the query with the PREFIX for Wikidata and make sure it's properly formatted in SPARQL syntax.\n\nI should double-check that Wikidata uses 'wdt' for properties and 'wd' for entities.

So, the final query should look something like selecting ?uri where ?uri is the object of P38 from Q148.\n\nLet me make sure there are no typos and that the syntax is correct.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the DBpedia query. It's selecting all URIs where the resource is an island and belongs to Japan. The key entities and relations here are 'island' and 'country'. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, 'island' in DBpedia maps to 'Q23442' in Wikidata. The 'country' relation maps to 'P17', and Japan is 'Q17'.\n\nSo in Wikidata, I need to find all items that are islands (Q23442) and have country (P17) as Japan (Q17).\n\nNow, in Wikidata SPARQL, instead of using triples like in DBpedia, we use 'wd' and 'p' prefixes. So the structure becomes something like: ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q23442 for the type, and ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q17 for the country.\n\nPutting it all together, I should write a query that selects distinct items with these two conditions. That should give me all the islands belonging to Japan in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations:**\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves islands (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Island>`) that belong to Japan (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan>`).\n   - The relation used is `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>`.\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - `Island` in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q23442` in Wikidata.\n   - `country` in DBpedia maps to `wdt:P17` in Wikidata.\n   - `Japan` in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q17` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - We use `wdt:P31` to assert that the item is an instance of an island (`wd:Q23442`).\n   - We use `wdt:P17` to assert that the country is Japan (`wd:Q17`).\n   - We select all distinct items that satisfy these conditions.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q23442 ;\n         wdt:P17 wd:Q17 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user by developing a SPARQL query for Wikidata, given that they already have one for DBpedia. The question is about who developed World of Warcraft. Let me think through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I start by understanding the original query. It's using DBpedia's ontology and resources. The query selects the URI of the developer where World of Warcraft has the developer property. The prefixes are dbo for the ontology and res for the resource.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia entities to Wikidata. Looking at the ER2 mappings, World of Warcraft in DBpedia corresponds to Q131007 in Wikidata. The developer property in DBpedia (dbo:developer) maps to P178 in Wikidata.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using prefixes like dbo and res, we use the full URIs or the prefixes defined in Wikidata's namespace. The common prefix is wdt for property statements and wd for entities.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. **Subject**: The game is World of Warcraft, which is Q131007 in Wikidata.\n2. **Predicate**: The developer is P178 in Wikidata.\n3. **Object**: We're looking for the URI of the developer, so we'll use a variable, maybe `?developer`.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct developers where Q131007 has the P178 property. In Wikidata, properties are accessed with `wdt:`. So, the triple would be `wd:Q131007 wdt:P178 ?developer`.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The prefixes in Wikidata are usually defined as `wd` for entities and `wdt` for properties. So yes, the query would use `wdt:P178`.\n\nI think that's all. I don't need any additional triples or filters here since the question is straightforward. So the SPARQL query should be:\n\n`PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>`\n`PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`\n`SELECT DISTINCT ?developer WHERE { wd:Q131007 wdt:P178 ?developer }`\n\nLet me double-check if there's any additional syntax needed. Sometimes, in Wikidata, using `[]` for the object might be a shorthand, but in this case, just binding it to a variable should suffice. Also, ensuring that it's a SELECT DISTINCT to get unique developers. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the developer of World of Warcraft is constructed by mapping the DBpedia entities and relations to their corresponding Wikidata equivalents. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Entities and Relations**:\n   - **World of Warcraft** in DBpedia maps to `Q131007` in Wikidata.\n   - **developer** in DBpedia maps to property `P178` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd` for entities and `wdt` for property statements.\n   - Fetch the distinct developers of World of Warcraft.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?developer \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q131007 wdt:P178 ?developer\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the given SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. Let me first understand what the original query does.\n\nThe original query is counting distinct URIs where the URI is a Company and its industry is either exactly Advertising or contains the word 'advertising' in a case-insensitive way.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that:\n\n1. DBpedia ontology 'Company' maps to Wikidata's Q4830453.\n2. DBpedia's 'industry' property maps to Wikidata's P452.\n3. DBpedia's 'Advertising' resource maps to three Wikidata entities: Q854995, Q37038, and Q1286627.\n\nSo, I need to replicate the structure of the original query but using Wikidata's identifiers.\n\nFirst, I'll start the query with selecting the count of distinct items. In Wikidata, items are often represented with 'wd:' prefix. So I'll use `WD:Q4830453` for the company.\n\nNext, the 'industry' property in DBpedia is P452 in Wikidata. I'll need to use `pq:P452` and `ps:P452` for the qualifiers, similar to how it's done in DBpedia.\n\nNow, for the filtering part. The original query uses a UNION to check if the industry is either exactly Advertising or if it contains 'advertising' case-insensitively. However, in Wikidata, it's more efficient to use a regex filter directly on the label. So I can combine both conditions into a single regex filter that matches any case variation of 'advertising'.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the count of distinct ?item where ?item is a company and its industry label matches 'advertising' in any case. I'll structure it with the `rdfs:label` filter and use `i` for case insensitivity in the regex.\n\nLet me double-check the syntax. Wikidata uses `prefixes` with `wd:` for entities, `wdt:` for direct claims, `pq:` for qualifiers, `ps:` for qualifier values. But in this case, I think `rdfs:label` is used directly with the entity.\n\nWait, actually, in Wikidata, to get the label, you can use `rdfs:label`, but sometimes you might need to handle different languages. However, since the original query didn't specify a language, I'll assume we're checking labels in any language, or perhaps default to English.\n\nSo the final query should be something like:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c) WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453.\n  ?item p:P452 ?industryStatement.\n  ?industryStatement ps:P452 ?industry.\n  FILTER(regex(LCASE(str(?industry)), \"advertising\")).\n  ?industry rdfs:label ?industryLabel.\n  FILTER(LCASE(?industryLabel) = \"advertising\" || regex(in(LCASE(?industryLabel)), \"advertising\"))\n}\n\nWait, but that might be redundant. Maybe just checking the label against the regex is sufficient.\n\nSo simplifying, I can just use the label with a regex filter:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c) WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453.\n  ?item p:P452 ?stmt.\n  ?stmt ps:P452 ?industry.\n  FILTERREGEX(LCASE(str(?industry)), \"advertising\", \"i\").\n}\n\nAlternatively, since the industry is an item, perhaps using the label directly:\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c) WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453.\n  ?item wdt:P452/wdtn:P452 ?industryId.\n  FILTERREGEX(str(?industryId), \"advertising\", \"i\").\n}\n\nWait, no, the 'industry' in Wikidata is a property with qualifiers, so the correct approach is to use the 'p' and 'ps' syntax.\n\nI think the best way is to use the label of the industry and apply the regex. So, I'll include the label filter.\n\nFinal thought: The correct approach is to retrieve the industry as a statement, then get its value, and either check the value's URI or its label. Since the original query used a regex on the industry URI, in Wikidata, it's better to use the label. So, capturing the label and applying the regex on it.\n\nTherefore, the final query uses the industry's label and filters it.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata, we need to map the entities and properties accordingly. \n\n1. **Entities and Properties Mapping**:\n   - `Company` in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q4830453` in Wikidata.\n   - `industry` in DBpedia maps to `P452` in Wikidata.\n   - `Advertising` in DBpedia maps to multiple Wikidata entities, but we'll use the label for filtering.\n\n2. **Query Construction**:\n   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT ?item)` to count unique companies.\n   - Filter companies where their industry label contains \"advertising\" case-insensitively.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c)\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453.\n  ?item p:P452 ?stmt.\n  ?stmt ps:P452 ?industry.\n  ?industry rdfs:label ?industryLabel.\n  FILTER(REGEX(LCASE(?industryLabel), \"advertising\"))\n}\n```\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?c)\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q4830453.\n  ?item p:P452 ?stmt.\n  ?stmt ps:P452 ?industry.\n  ?industry rdfs:label ?industryLabel.\n  FILTER(REGEX(LCASE(?industryLabel), \"advertising\"))\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which university Angela Merkel attended by using the provided information. I see that the user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia and some mappings to Wikidata. My task is to convert that DBpedia query into a Wikidata query.\n\nFirst, in the original SPARQL query for DBpedia, the query is selecting ?university where Angela Merkel's almaMater is that university. So the main components are the entity Angela Merkel, the relation almaMater, and the variable ?university.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia resource for Angela Merkel is mapped to Wikidata's Q567. Similarly, the DBpedia ontology term almaMater is mapped to Wikidata's P69, which stands for \"educated at.\"\n\nNow, in Wikidata, the variables and query structure are slightly different. Instead of using dbo: and res:, everything in Wikidata is based on the WD and wds prefixes. So I'll need to use WD:Q567 for Angela Merkel and wdt:P69 for the educated at property.\n\nI should write a SPARQL query that selects ?university where Angela Merkel (WD:Q567) has an educated at (wdt:P69) relation to ?university. Also, I need to make sure to specify that Angela Merkel is the subject. Sometimes, in Wikidata, it's good to include a label for clarity, so I might add a filter to look for Angela Merkel by her name.\n\nPutting it all together, the query would start with the prefixes for Wikidata. Then, I'll select the distinct university, ensuring no duplicates are returned. I'll specify that Angela Merkel is the subject, use the educated at property, and maybe include her label to filter correctly.\n\nI should also validate the query to make sure the properties and entities align with Wikidata's structure. Once everything seems correct, I can present the final SPARQL query.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided mappings and the existing DBpedia query, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify theEntities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity**: Angela Merkel \u2192 `wd:Q567` (from ER2 mappings).\n   - **Relation**: almaMater \u2192 `wdt:P69` (from ER2 mappings).\n\n2. **Structure the Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd:` and `wdt:`.\n   - Select the distinct university Angela Merkel attended.\n   \n3. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Filter for Angela Merkel by her name to ensure accuracy.\n   - Use `wdt:P69` to find her educational institution.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?university \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?university .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(LCASE(str(wd:Q567)), \"angela merkel\"))\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the university attended by Angela Merkel using Wikidata's properties and structure."

Instead of 'a' for type, Wikidata uses 'wdt:P31' for \"instance of\". Also, the starring property is P161.\n\nI need to construct the query in Wikidata's syntax, which uses 'WHERE' clauses and prefixes like 'wd' for entities and 'wdt' for property values.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct items where the item is an instance of TelevisionShow (Q15416) and has Neil Patrick Harris (Q485310) as a cast member (P161).\n\nI should also include the appropriate prefixes for Wikidata, which are typically:\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nThe structured query would then select 'item' instead of 'uri', and use the correct predicate and object.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure to format it correctly in SPARQL syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo find all TV shows with Neil Patrick Harris in Wikidata, we'll use his Wikidata ID and the correct property for cast members.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find all movies starring Tom Cruise, similar to the DBpedia query they provided. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I should understand the original query. It's using DBpedia to select all URIs where the URI is a film and it stars Tom Cruise. The query uses the DBpedia ontology for Film and the starring relation.\n\nNow, the user provided an entity and relation mapping (ER2) that maps DBpedia entities to Wikidata. Let me look at that. The Film concept in DBpedia is mapped to Q11424 in Wikidata. The starring relation (dbpedia's starring) is mapped to P161 in Wikidata, which is \"cast member\". Tom Cruise in DBpedia maps to Q37079 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the goal is to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, things are structured with items (like Q37079 for Tom Cruise) and properties (like P161). The query needs to find items that are films and have Tom Cruise as a cast member.\n\nI remember that in SPARQL, Wikidata uses the 'wd:' prefix for items and 'p:' or 'wdt:' for properties. So, the film would be of type 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424' which can be written as 'wd:Q11424'. The starring relation is 'wdt:P161'.\n\nPutting it together, the query should select distinct items where each item is of type Q11424 (Film) and has a P161 (cast member) that is Q37079 (Tom Cruise).\n\nI should make sure the syntax is correct. Using 'SELECT DISTINCT' ensures we don't get duplicate entries. Each condition in the WHERE clause should use the correct prefixes and structure.\n\nLet me double-check the mappings:\n- Film (dbpedia) \u2192 Q11424 (wikidata)\n- starring (dbpedia) \u2192 P161 (wikidata)\n- Tom Cruise \u2192 Q37079 (wikidata)\n\nYes, that all lines up. So, the final query should correctly retrieve all films where Tom Cruise is a cast member using Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint.\n</think>\n\nLet's construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata step by step based on the mappings and analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key entities and relations in the DBpedia query.**\n- **Entity (Resource):** Tom Cruise\n- **Relation (Predicate):** starring\n- **Class/Type:** Film\n\n**Step 2: Map DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata using ER2 mappings.**\n- **Film (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film):** http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424\n- **starring (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring):** http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161\n- **Tom Cruise (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise):** http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079\n\n**Step 3: Construct the equivalent SPARQL query in Wikidata syntax.**\n- We will use the `wd:` prefix for Wikidata entities and properties.\n- The query pattern remains the same: retrieve all distinct resources of type \"Film\" that have \"Tom Cruise\" as a cast member.\n\n**Step 4: Write the final SPARQL query for Wikidata.**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE \n{\n  ?uri wdt:P161 wd:Q37079 ;\n     wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

I know that in DBpedia, the query uses `dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy` and the property `dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace`. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia JFK resource maps to Wikidata's Q9696, and the deathPlace property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P20. So, in Wikidata, I should use `wd:Q9696` for JFK and `p:P20` for the death place property.\n\nNow, I need to structure the SPARQL query correctly for Wikidata. The pattern in the DBpedia query is SELECT DISTINCT the URI where JFK has the deathPlace property. Translating that to Wikidata, I think it would be something like selecting the value where Q9696 has property P20.\n\nBut wait, in Wikidata, properties are usually prefixed with `p:` and you can specify the value in the triple. So, the query should look for `wd:Q9696 p:P20 ?uri`. \n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax. Wikidata might require `PREFIX` declarations, but sometimes they're optional in the query. So, including `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>` and `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>` might help, even if they're not strictly necessary in the current setup.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct URIs where JFK (Q9696) has the death place (P20). That should retrieve the assassination location's URI from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo find out where JFK was assassinated using Wikidata, we need to convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata's syntax. We'll use the mappings from ER2 to replace the resources and properties.\n\n1. **Identify the_entities_and_relations**:  \n   - The entity in the query is \"John F. Kennedy\" identified by `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy` in DBpedia, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9696` in Wikidata.  \n   - The relation is \"death place\" identified by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace` in DBpedia, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P20` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Understand_the_query_pattern**:  \n   The DBpedia query retrieves the death place (`?uri`) of John F. Kennedy (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy>`) by looking for the `deathPlace` property.  \n\n3. **,map_to_Wikidata_properties**:  \n   - The entity `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy` maps to `wd:Q9696`.  \n   - The property `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace` maps to `wdt:P20`.\n\n4. **Construct_the_Wikidata_query**:  \n   Using the Wikidata mappings, the query to retrieve the death place becomes:  \n   ```sparql  \n   SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q9696 wdt:P20 ?uri }  \n   ```  \n\n5. **Validate_the_query**:  \n   Ensure that all entities and properties are correctly mapped and that the query follows Wikidata's syntax.  \n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql  \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {  \n    wd:Q9696 wdt:P20 ?uri  \n}  \n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The original question is asking which river the Brooklyn Bridge crosses. I've been given a SPARQL query for DBpedia, and I need to create the equivalent for Wikidata using the provided mappings.\n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query:\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  res:Brooklyn_Bridge dbo:crosses ?uri \n}\n\nSo, it's selecting the river(s) that the Brooklyn Bridge crosses. The predicate here is dbo:crosses, and the subject is res:Brooklyn_Bridge.\n\nNow, the ER2 mappings provided are:\n[\n  {\n    \"dbpedia_id\": \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brooklyn_Bridge\",\n    \"wikidata_ids\": [\n      \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q125006\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"dbpedia_id\": \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/crosses\",\n    \"wikidata_ids\": [\n      \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P177\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nThis tells me that in DBpedia, the entity is referred to as http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brooklyn_Bridge, which maps to Q125006 in Wikidata. The relation dbo:crosses maps to P177 in Wikidata, which stands for 'crosses' as well.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I need to query Q125006 for property P177.\n\nWikidata's SPARQL syntax uses the 'wd:' prefix for entities and 'p:' for properties, followed by the specific property number and, if needed, a qualifier like 'ps:' for the main statement.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look for all values of P177 for entity Q125006.\n\nTherefore, the SPARQL query for Wikidata would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q125006 p:P177 ?uri\n}\n\nThis query selects distinct rivers (URI) that are the value of the 'crosses' property (P177) for the Brooklyn Bridge (Q125006).\n\nI don't think I need any additional prefixes since 'wd:' and 'p:' are standard in Wikidata SPARQL. Also, 'DISTINCT' ensures we don't get duplicate entries if there are any.\n\nI should double-check if P177 is indeed the right property. From the mapping, yes, it's the same as dbo:crosses. So this should work.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata will utilize the mapped entity and property from DBpedia. The query retrieves all rivers crossed by the Brooklyn Bridge using the corresponding property in Wikidata.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q125006 p:P177 ?uri\n}\n```"

So in Wikidata, we'll use `wd:Q10843402`.\n\n2. **birthPlace in DBpedia** is mapped to Wikidata's P19. So the property becomes `p:P19`.\n\n3. **Moscow in DBpedia** is mapped to Wikidata's Q649. So the object is `wd:Q649`.\n\nIn Wikidata, the structure of the query will involve two main parts: the Occupation (swimmer) and the birth place (Moscow).\n\nI remember that in Wikidata, to state someone's occupation, you use `p:P106` with the value being the occupation. So I'll need to include `p:P106` and `wd:Q10843402` to specify that the person is a swimmer.\n\nThe birth place is straightforward with `p:P19` and `wd:Q649`.\n\nPutting it all together, each swimmer will have two triples: one for their occupation and another for their birth place.\n\nSo the query should select distinct `?item` where `?item p:P106 wd:Q10843402` and `?item p:P19 wd:Q649`.\n\nI think that's all.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the last movie Alec Guinness was in. Let me start by understanding what the original query was doing in DBpedia.\n\nThe original query used DBpedia to get the last film Alec Guinness starred in. It selected the film URI where it's typed as a Film, starring Alec Guinness, and had a release date. It then ordered those by release date in descending order and limited it to one result.\n\nNow, I need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to Wikidata. The ER2 mapping provided helps with this. So, dbo:Film in DBpedia maps to Q11424 in Wikidata, which is \"film\". dbo:starring maps to P161, which is \"cast member\". The releaseDate, dbo:releaseDate, maps to P577, which is \"publication date\". And Alec Guinness is entity Q103894.\n\nIn Wikidata, items are identified with \"wd:\" and properties with \"p:\". So, I'll need to structure the query to select items where they are an instance of film, have Alec Guinness as cast, and have a publication date. Then, order by publication date descending and limit to one result.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the SPARQL query with the appropriate prefixes, using the Wikidata properties. I have to ensure that I'm selecting the right variables and filtering correctly. Also, in Wikidata, you need to use \"were\" instead of \"a\", or in some cases, you can just use the property directly if it's for a type.\n\nWait, no, in Wikidata, to specify the type, you use wdt:P31. So,film would be wdt:P31 wd:Q11424. Then starring would be p:P161, and since p:P161 returns a value, I'll use pq:P161 to specify that Alec Guinness is the cast member.\n\nSo, breaking it down, the query would select ?item where ?item is a film, has Alec Guinness as cast, and has a publication date. Then, order by the publication date in descending order and take the top one.\n\nI think that covers it. Let me write that out in SPARQL syntax, making sure to use the correct prefixes and structure for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first identify the mappings from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking for the second highest mountain on Earth, but this time using Wikidata instead of DBpedia. They've already provided the DBpedia SPARQL query, so I need to translate that to Wikidata's syntax.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations in the original DBpedia query. The query selects mountains and orders them by elevation in descending order, then skips the first result to get the second highest. The key parts here are the type 'Mountain' and the property 'elevation'.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, DBpedia's 'Mountain' class corresponds to Wikidata's Q8502, and the 'elevation' property is mapped to Wikidata's P2044. So I can substitute these directly.\n\nNext, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. The original query used a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause. In Wikidata, I'll need to use similar constructs but adjust the syntax for Wikidata's query service.\n\nI'll start by selecting the variable, which in this case is the mountain itself, represented by '?item'. The WHERE clause will define that this item is an instance of Mountain (Q8502) and has the elevation property (P2044) with a value I'll call '?elevation'.\n\nNow, to order the results, I'll use ORDER BY with DESC to get the highest first. Since we want the second highest, I need to skip the first one. In SPARQL, that's done with 'OFFSET 1', and then limit the results to just one with 'LIMIT 1'.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will select the item, where the item is a mountain and has an elevation. It will order these by elevation descending, skip the first, and return the next one.\n\nI should double-check to make sure that the properties are correctly mapped and that the syntax is correct for Wikidata. Wikidata uses 'wd:' as a prefix for entities and 'p:' for properties usually, so I should make sure those prefixes are correctly applied.\n\nWait, no, in Wikidata SPARQL, the prefixes can be set at the top, but if not, you can use the full URLs. Since the query doesn't specify prefixes, I should use the full URIs, but often people use 'wd:' for entities and 'wdt:' for properties. So maybe I should adjust it to use those prefixes to make the query cleaner.\n\nHmm, but the ER2 mappings provided use the full URLs, but in practice, using prefixes is more common. So perhaps I should include a PREFIX section at the top to define 'wd' as 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/' and 'wdt' as 'http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/'. That would make the query more readable.\n\nSo the final query would have the PREFIX lines, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause with the necessary triples, and finally the ORDER BY, OFFSET, and LIMIT.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary steps. The query should correctly retrieve the second highest mountain by following these steps.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation and the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Key Entities and Relations**\n\n- **Entity**: Mountain (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mountain>`)\n- **Relation**: elevation (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/elevation>`)\n\n**Step 2: Map Entities and Relations to Wikidata**\n\n- `dbpedia_id`: Mountain \u2192 `wikidata_ids`: Q8502 (`<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502>`)\n- `dbpedia_id`: elevation \u2192 `wikidata_ids`: P2044 (`<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2044>`)\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Wikidata SPARQL Query**\n\nWe need to retrieve entities of type \"Mountain\" and their elevation values, order them by elevation in descending order, skip the first result (highest elevation), and return the second one.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q8502;\n        p:P2044 ?statement.\n  ?statement ps:P2044 ?elevation.\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nOFFSET 1\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\n**Step 4: Validate the Query**\n\nThe query adheres to Wikidata's data model:\n- `wdt:P31` is used to state that an item is an instance of a class.\n- `p:P2044` and `ps:P2044` are used to access the elevation value.\n- The `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`, and `LIMIT` clauses are correctly structured to retrieve the second highest mountain.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query**\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q8502;\n        p:P2044 ?statement.\n  ?statement ps:P2044 ?elevation.\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nOFFSET 1\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

The query uses `dbo:populationTotal` for the population. Now, looking at the ER2 mappings, Cairo in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities, Q85 and Q20230483. I should probably use the main one, Q85, which is more general.\n\nNext, the population relation in DBpedia is `dbo:populationTotal`, which maps to Wikidata's P1082. So in Wikidata, we'll use `wdt:P1082` for the population property.\n\nNow, the structure of the DBpedia query is selecting the population where Cairo has that population. In Wikidata, we'll structure it similarly but with the prefixes for Wikidata. So the query will ask for the population (`?pop`) where the entity (Cairo) has the population property.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll set the PREFIX for Wikidata, use the entity Q85, and the property P1082. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax with `wdt:` for the property and `wd:` for the entity.\n\nFinally, I'll write the SPARQL query ensuring it fetches the population value correctly. I should also consider if there are any qualifiers or if the value is directly available. In this case, it seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata and maintain the query structure.\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: Cairo (DBpedia: `dbr:Cairo`, Wikidata: `Q85`)\n   - **Relation**: populationTotal (DBpedia: `dbo:populationTotal`, Wikidata: `P1082`)\n\n2. **Query Pattern**: The query retrieves the population of Cairo.\n\n3. **Construct Wikidata Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity `Q85` for Cairo.\n   - Use the Wikidata property `P1082` for population.\n   - Maintain the same query structure, selecting `?pop`.\n\n4. **Final Query**:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?pop WHERE {\n  wd:Q85 wdt:P1082 ?pop\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The user has provided some context with mappings between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and relations. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original SPARQL query for DBpedia, it's selecting the count of distinct URIs where Benjamin Franklin is connected via the 'child' relation. The query is:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri) AS ?c)\nWHERE {\n  res:Benjamin_Franklin dbo:child ?uri\n}\n\nSo, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query. From the provided ER2 mappings, I see that Benjamin Franklin in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q34969. Also, the DBpedia ontology 'child' is mapped to Wikidata's P40, which stands for 'child'.\n\nIn Wikidata, properties are prefixed with 'wdt:', and items are prefixed with 'wd:'. So, I'll need to adjust the prefixes accordingly. The structure will involve selecting the count of distinct items where Benjamin Franklin (Q34969) is connected via P40 (child).\n\nOne thing to note is that in Wikidata, the syntax uses 'wdt:P40' for properties. So, putting it together, the query should select all entities ?child such that Benjamin Franklin has the property P40 with those entities.\n\nLet me draft the query:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?child) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P40 ?child\n}\n\nI should double-check if this aligns with Wikidata's data model. Wikidata typically uses 'wdt:' for direct properties, which seems correct here. Also, the use of DISTINCT ensures we count each child only once, avoiding duplicates.\n\nI think this should correctly fetch the number of children Benjamin Franklin had according to Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we'll map the DBpedia entities and relations to their corresponding Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n1. The DBpedia resource `res:Benjamin_Franklin` maps to the Wikidata entity `wd:Q34969`.\n2. The DBpedia property `dbo:child` maps to the Wikidata property `wdt:P40`.\n\nThe logical structure of the DBpedia query is to count the number of distinct children of Benjamin Franklin. We'll maintain this structure in the Wikidata query by using the appropriate prefixes and syntax.\n\nHere's the Wikidata SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?child) AS ?c)\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P40 ?child\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the count of distinct children of Benjamin Franklin from the Wikidata knowledge graph.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?child) AS ?c)\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P40 ?child\n}\n</sparql>"

The goal is to create a similar query but for Wikidata instead. \n\nLooking at the provided context, I notice there's an ER2 mappings section which connects DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata counterparts. This will be crucial because it allows me to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nThe DBpedia query is straightforward: it selects the elevation where the subject is D\u00fcsseldorf Airport and the predicate is 'elevation'. So, the query is essentially asking for the value of 'elevation' for the entity 'D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport' in DBpedia.\n\nNow, to translate this into Wikidata, I need to find out the corresponding entities and properties using the ER2 mappings. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, the first entry gives the DBpedia resource for D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, which is mapped to the Wikidata entity Q58226. So, in Wikidata, the airport is represented by 'wd:Q58226'.\n\nNext, the second entry in ER2 maps the DBpedia property 'dbo:elevation' to the Wikidata property 'w(digits:P2044)'. This indicates that in Wikidata, the elevation is represented by the property P2044, and I might need to access it using a specific syntax, possibly involving units (hence 'w(digits:P2044)' maybe refers to a way to express the value with its unit).\n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query in Wikidata should select the value where the subject is Q58226 and the predicate is P2044. In Wikidata, properties are often accessed using the 'p' and 'ps' prefixes, but usually, it's 'wdt' for the property and 'wd' for the entity.\n\nWait, actually, in Wikidata, to get a property's value, we typically use 'wdt:P...' for direct properties and 'ps:P...' for qualifiers and so on. Since elevation is a straightforward property, using 'wdt:P2044' should suffice.\n\nSo, the structure of the query would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?elevation\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q58226 wdt:P2044 ?elevation.\n}\n\nThis query will retrieve the elevation value from Wikidata for D\u00fcsseldorf Airport. I should make sure to limit the results if possible, but the original query doesn't specify, so maybe just retrieving the first result is sufficient.\n\nI should also consider if the elevation might have units attached and whether I need to extract just the numerical value or the entire statement. In this case, since the original DBpedia query just retrieves the elevation value, I can assume that Wikidata's 'P2044' directly provides the number, possibly in meters as D\u00fcsseldorf Airport's elevation is 45 meters above sea level.\n\nOne more thing to check: does the Wikidata entity Q58226 actually have the P2044 property? I can quickly verify this by looking up Q58226 on Wikidata, but assuming the mappings are correct, it should be accurate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata would look like the one I wrote above, using the 'wdt' prefix for the property and 'wd' for the entity.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport from Wikidata, we can construct a SPARQL query using the mappings provided. The key steps were identifying the correct Wikidata entities and properties and structuring the query accordingly.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?elevation \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q58226 wdt:P2044 ?elevation.\n}\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query fetches the elevation value for D\u00fcsseldorf Airport using the appropriate Wikidata entities and properties."

The query selects the URI of the country associated with Mecca. So, the key here is identifying Mecca and its country relation.\n\nNext, using the ER2 mappings provided, I can map DBpedia's Mecca to Wikidata's Q5806. Similarly, the country relation in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P17.

It's selecting the height of Claudia Schiffer. So, the main entity is Claudia Schiffer, and the property is height.\n\nLooking at the provided ER2 mappings, Claudia Schiffer in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q76717. The height property in DBpedia (dbo:height) is mapped to Wikidata's P2048. So, I need to replace the DBpedia resources and properties with their Wikidata equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are usually prefixed with wd, and properties with p. However, the actual property for height is P2048, but in SPARQL, sometimes you can use the direct property or the statement. So, I should use wdt:P2048 for the height value.\n\nI should also update the PREFIX from dbo and res to the appropriate Wikidata ones. Wikidata typically uses the prefix wdid for entities and wdt for properties. So, I'll define PREFIX wdid as <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and PREFIX wdt as <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?height where wdid:Q76717 has wdt:P2048 as ?height.

Yes, P2048 corresponds to 'height' in Wikidata, so that's correct.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the query structure aligns with Wikidata's model. In Wikidata, the property is straightforward, so using wdt:P2048 should be sufficient without needing any additional qualifiers or statements.\n\nSo, the final query should look like selecting ?height where the Claudia Schiffer entity (Q76717) has the height property (P2048) set to ?height.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts. \n\n/sparql\nPREFIX wdid: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?height \nWHERE {\n    wdid:Q76717 wdt:P2048 ?height\n}\n/sparql\n\nThis query retrieves Claudia Schiffer's height from Wikidata."

It selects distinct URIs where Lou Reed's resource has the genre relation. So, I need to find the equivalent in Wikidata. In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:', and properties with 'p:' or 'ps:' for statements and qualifiers, but since we're just looking for the main genre, I'll use 'p:'.\n\nSo, the entity for Lou Reed in Wikidata is wd:Q189080, and the genre property is p:P136. I'll structure the query to select the genre values from these. I should also make sure it's a distinct query to avoid duplicates and use the WHERE clause to specify the triple.\n\nPutting it all together, the Wikidata query should look like this: It starts with PREFIX to define the namespace, then a SELECT DISTINCT statement, asking for the ?val where wd:Q189080 has p:P136 leading to ?val.\n\nI don't think any validation is needed because the structure follows standard Wikidata practices, and the mappings are direct from the ER2.

Let me start by breaking down what's given.\n\nThe original query in DBpedia uses the dbo: namespace for properties and res: for resources. It's selecting the birthplace of Frank Sinatra. The query is:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?place \nWHERE { res:Frank_Sinatra dbo:birthPlace ?place }\n\nNow, there's an ER2 mapping provided that maps DBpedia entities to Wikidata. Looking at that:\n\n- The DBpedia resource \"Frank_Sinatra\" maps to Wikidata's Q40912.\n- The DBpedia property \"birthPlace\" maps to Wikidata's P19.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, Frank Sinatra is Q40912 and birth place is P19.\n\nNext step is to construct the SPARQL query. In Wikidata, we typically use the wd prefix for entities and p for properties. So, Frank Sinatra is wd:Q40912, and the property is p:P19. The object would be the place we're looking for, which is a wdv: value.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure would be:\n\nSELECT ?place\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q40912 p:P19 ?place .\n}\n\nI should also make sure to use the DISTINCT keyword to avoid duplicates, just like in the DBpedia query. So adding DISTINCT before ?place.\n\nFinally, wrapping it up with the appropriate prefixes, but in Wikidata, the prefixes are usually predefined, so I can use wd and wdv directly without declaring them.\n\nSo the complete query should be:\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve Frank Sinatra's birthplace from Wikidata, we map the DBpedia resources and properties to their Wikidata equivalents and structure the query accordingly.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?place\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q40912 p:P19 ?place.\n}\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the original query for DBpedia. It's selecting the URI of cities where the population total is ordered in ascending order, and it's limiting the results to just one. The key parts here are the type (City) and the property used (populationTotal). \n\nNext, I refer to the ER2 mappings provided. I see that DBpedia's City (dbo:City) corresponds to Wikidata's Q515, and DBpedia's populationTotal (dbo:populationTotal) maps to Wikidata's P1082, which is population.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I need to find all entities that are instances of City (Q515) and have a population value (P1082). Then, I should sort these cities by their population in ascending order and return the one with the smallest number.\n\nI recall that in Wikidata, we use the prefix `wd` for entities and `p` for properties, but sometimes it's more explicit to use the full URIs, but for this case, using the prefixes should be fine.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should:\n- Prefix the relevant namespaces.\n- Select the city's IRI and the population.\n- Filter for items where the type is City and has a population.\n- Order by population in ascending order.\n- Limit to one result.\n\nI should make sure the syntax is correct, especially the placement of the filter and order clauses. Also, ensuring that the result includes both the city and its population for clarity, though the original query only selects the URI. But in Wikidata, it's common to include the actual value as well.\n\nI also need to check if the population data in Wikidata uses the same datatype, probably decimal, so the ordering should work correctly. If there are issues with missing data or non-numeric values, but given the original query doesn't handle that, I'll proceed as is.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the query with proper line breaks and indentation for readability.\n</think>\n\nTo find the city with the least inhabitants in Wikidata, we can use the following SPARQL query. This query utilizes the mapped properties from DBpedia to Wikidata to fetch the required information.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?city ?cityLabel ?population\nWHERE \n{\n    ?city wdt:P31 wd:Q515 .    # ?city is a city\n    ?city wdt:P1082 ?population . # ?city has population\n    \n    SERVICE wikibase:label { \n        bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" . \n    }\n}\nORDER BY ASC(?population)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query works as follows:\n- **PREFIXES**: Defines the necessary prefixes for Wikidata.\n- **SELECT**: Retrieves the city URI, its label (name), and population.\n- **WHERE**: Filters for entities that are cities and have a population value.\n- **SERVICE**: Ensures the city name is returned in English.\n- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the cities by population in ascending order.\n- **LIMIT**: Returns only the city with the smallest population.\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the city with the least inhabitants using Wikidata's properties."

The question is asking which television shows were created by Walt Disney. \n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query, it uses PREFIXES for dbo, res, and rdf. The SELECT is looking for ?uri where ?uri is of type TelevisionShow and has creator Walt Disney.\n\nThe ER2 mappings provided tell me that in DBpedia, TelevisionShow is dbo:TelevisionShow, which maps to Q15416 in Wikidata. The creator relation in DBpedia (dbo:creator) maps to P170 in Wikidata. Walt Disney in DBpedia is res:Walt_Disney, which maps to Q8704.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, I'll need to construct the query using these mappings. The structure would involve selecting items where the item is an instance of TelevisionShow (Q15416), and the creator (P170) is Walt Disney (Q8704).\n\nI'm a bit new to Sparql, so I need to make sure the syntax is correct. I'll use the PREFIX wdt for Wikidata properties and p for predicates. Wait, actually, in Wikidata, properties are accessed via the p and ps prefixes. But maybe for this query, using the wd prefix for entities and wdt for property values is more straightforward.\n\nSo, I'll start by prefixing the entities. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll state that ?item is a TelevisionShow, which in Wikidata is wd:Q15416. Then, I'll set the creator property (wdt:P170) to be Walt Disney, wd:Q8704.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select all items where they are of type Q15416 and have P170 set to Q8704. I don't see any filters or additional conditions, so it's a straightforward query.\n\nI should also ensure that the query is correctly structured with the prefixes and that the variables are properly used. Since the DBpedia query used DISTINCT, I might include that as well to avoid duplicates.\n\nI think that's all. Let's put it together.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relations**:\n   - TelevisionShow in DBpedia maps to Q15416 in Wikidata.\n   - creator in DBpedia maps to P170 in Wikidata.\n   - Walt Disney in DBpedia maps to Q8704 in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the Wikidata query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd` for entities and `wdt` for property values.\n   - Select items that are instances of Q15416 (TelevisionShow).\n   - Filter items where the creator (P170) is Q8704 (Walt Disney).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 .\n  ?item wdt:P170 wd:Q8704 .\n}\n```"

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original query on DBpedia was selecting URIs where the resource is a Holiday and located in Sweden. The ER2 mappings are essential here because they translate DBpedia entities to Wikidata. \n\nLooking at ER2, the DBpedia ontology for Holiday maps to Wikidata's Q1445650. So, in Wikidata, I'll use `wd:Q1445650` to represent the holiday concept.\n\nNext, the country relation in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P17, which stands for \"country\". So, I'll use `p:P17` as the predicate.\n\nFor Sweden, DBpedia's resource maps to Wikidata's Q34. Therefore, the object in the triple will be `wd:Q34`.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure of the query in Wikidata would involve selecting items where the item is an instance of Holiday and is located in Sweden. In SPARQL, this translates to using `wdt:P31` for \"instance of\" and `wdt:P17` for \"country\".\n\nSo, the query would select all items where `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650` and `?item wdt:P17 wd:Q34`. I need to make sure this is formatted correctly in SPARQL syntax for Wikidata, using the correct prefixes and structure.\n\nI should double-check that the predicates and entities are correctly mapped. There's no need for an OFFSET or LIMIT here, just a simple SELECT DISTINCT to get all unique results.\n\nFinally, constructing the query ensures that it's valid and should return the desired holidays. Making sure to use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves all Swedish holidays, we need to map the DBpedia entities and relationships to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Holiday**: The concept of \"Holiday\" in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Holiday`) maps to Wikidata's `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1445650`.\n   - **Country**: The property \"country\" in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country`) maps to Wikidata's `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17`.\n   - **Sweden**: The resource \"Sweden\" in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden`) maps to Wikidata's `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity for \"Holiday\" (`wd:Q1445650`) and the property for \"country\" (`wdt:P17`).\n   - Filter for items where the \"country\" is Sweden (`wd:Q34`).\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650 ;\n         wdt:P17 wd:Q34 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all unique items in Wikidata that are instances of \"Holiday\" and are associated with Sweden."

I also need to use PREFIX to simplify the query, though SPARQL in Wikidata might not require it, but it's good practice.\n\nSo the final query will look like selecting distinct ?ni, using the Apple entity and the net income property in Wikidata syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: Apple Inc.\n   - **Relation**: netIncome\n\n2. **Map Entities and Relations Using ER2**:\n   - **Apple Inc.** in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc.`) maps to **Wikidata** (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312`).\n   - **netIncome** in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/netIncome`) maps to **Wikidata** (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2295`).\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query for Wikidata**:\n   - Use the Wikidata IDs for the entity and relation.\n   - Maintain the same query structure but use Wikidata's syntax.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?ni \nWHERE {\n  <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312> wdt:P2295 ?ni .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The query is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country> ?country .\n  ?country <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital> ?uri\n}\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I can convert the DBpedia entities to Wikidata. The Himalayas in DBpedia map to several Wikidata entities, including Q5451. The 'country' relation in DBpedia (dbpedia-ontology:country) maps to Wikidata's P17 (country), and the 'capital' relation (dbpedia-ontology:capital) maps to P36 (capital).\n\nSo, I need to find all entities that are countries related to the Himalayas (which can be identified using P17) and then get their capitals using P36.\n\nIn Wikidata, the main entity for the Himalayas is Q5451.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is asking in which country Limerick Lake is located. The user provided a DBpedia SPARQL query that retrieves the country of Limerick_Lake. Now, they want the equivalent query for Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource \"Limerick_Lake\" maps to Wikidata's \"Q6386177\". The relation \"dbo:country\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"P17\" in Wikidata, which stands for \"country\".\n\nSo, the original DBpedia query is:\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> PREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { res:Limerick_Lake dbo:country ?uri }\n\nNow, the task is to map this to Wikidata. Wikidata uses a different syntax and prefixes. Instead of 'dbo:country', we'll use 'wdt:P17' for the property. Since Wikidata's endpoint doesn't require prefixes for resources, we can directly use the Q and P numbers with 'wd:' as the prefix.\n\nSo, the structure would be:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?uri }\n\nI need to make sure I include the necessary prefixes, but in Wikidata, we usually just use 'wd' and 'wdt' without declaring them. However, to keep it explicit, I can include them.\n\nTherefore, the complete query with prefixes would be:\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?uri }\n\nI should double-check if 'P17' is indeed the correct property for country in Wikidata. Yes, P17 is \"country\", so that's correct. Also, ensuring that Q6386177 is the correct entity for Limerick Lake. According to the ER2, it is, so that should work.\n\nFinally, putting it all together and wrapping it in the <sparql> tags as the user requested.\n</think>\n\nThe process involved mapping DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that asks for Michael Jordan's height, similar to the given DBpedia query. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original DBpedia query. It uses the prefixes dbo and res. The query is selecting a variable ?num where Michael_Jordan has the property dbo:height. That makes sense because it's fetching the height value.\n\nNow, I need to map this to Wikidata. Looking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia resource for Michael Jordan is mapped to Wikidata's Q41421. So, in Wikidata, Michael Jordan is represented by wd:Q41421. Got that.\n\nNext, the property dbo:height in DBpedia is mapped to P2048 in Wikidata. That means in Wikidata, the height property is identified by wdt:P2048. I should note that in Wikidata, properties are prefixed with wdt: or p: depending on the context, but for the main property, wdt: is typically used.\n\nSo, putting this together, I need to structure a SPARQL query that asks for the height of entity Q41421 using property P2048. In Wikidata, the variable for the value would be something like ?height.\n\nThe standard structure for a SPARQL query in Wikidata would be:\n\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n...\nSELECT ?height WHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wds:P2048 ?height .\n}\n\nWait, actually, in Wikidata, when using direct properties, we often just use wd:P2048, but I think the correct prefix for direct properties is wdt, not wds. Maybe it's better to use the full URI or just stick with the standard prefixes.\n\nAlso, I remember that in Wikidata SPARQL, we don't always need the prefix definitions if we use the default ones, but including them makes it clearer.\n\nSo, adjusting the prefixes, I can define wd as the entity namespace and wdt as the direct property namespace. Then, in the WHERE clause, I specify wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height.\n\nSo the complete query would be:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?height WHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height .\n}\n\nI should make sure that ?height is the variable we're selecting. Alternatively, since the original query uses ?num, maybe I should keep that variable name for consistency, but it's not necessary. Using ?height might be more descriptive.\n\nWait, looking back at the DBpedia query, it uses ?num, so perhaps the Wikidata query should use the same variable name. But it's up to me since the variable name is arbitrary. For clarity, I can stick with ?height.\n\nLet me think if there's anything else. Does the query need any additional parts, like filtering or specifying the unit of measurement? The original DBpedia query just fetches the height value, so unless we need to convert units or get a label, this should suffice.\n\nI think that's all. So, I'll construct the query with the correct prefixes and syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for retrieving Michael Jordan's height from Wikidata, we first identify the corresponding entities and properties using the provided mapping. Michael Jordan is represented as `wd:Q41421` and the height property is `P2048`. Using Wikidata's prefixes, the query is formulated as follows:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?height \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the height value associated with Michael Jordan in Wikidata.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?height \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?height .\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that identifies the films where Clint Eastwood both directed and starred in. I'm a bit new to SPARQL and Wikidata, so I'll take this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the original DBpedia query to understand what it's doing. The query is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { \n  ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> ; \n  <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> \n}\n\nThis query looks for URIs of films (?uri) where Clint Eastwood is both the director and is starring in them. So, the two key relations here are \"director\" and \"starring,\" both linked to Clint Eastwood.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia elements to their equivalents in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. Let's look at the ER2:\n\n- \"director\" in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director) maps to Wikidata's P57 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P57).\n- \"Clint Eastwood\" in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood) maps to Wikidata's Q43203 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q43203).\n- \"starring\" in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring) maps to Wikidata's P161 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161).\n\nSo, in Wikidata terms, I need to find items where the director is Clint Eastwood (P57: Q43203) and the starring actor is also Clint Eastwood (P161: Q43203).\n\nNext, I should construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata's syntax. Wikidata's endpoint uses the \"wd:\" prefix for entities and \"p:\" or \"ps:\" for properties. \n\nIn Wikidata, properties are often used with the \"ps:\" prefix for the main statement. So, P57 would be \"ps:P57\" and P161 would be \"ps:P161\" or sometimes just \"p:P57\" for the predicate.\n\nThe structure of the query would be similar to the DBpedia one, but using the Wikidata properties and Clint Eastwood's Wikidata ID.\n\nSo, I'll start with:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film WHERE {\n  ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q43203 ;\n        wdt:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact syntax for Wikidata. Do I use \"wdt:\" or \"p:\"? I think \"wdt:\" is used for direct property access, while \"p:\" is for more complex statements with qualifiers.\n\nIn this case, since I'm just looking for the basic property-value pairs, using \"wdt:\" should suffice.\n\nLet me double-check if \"starring\" is indeed P161. Yes, in the ER2, \"starring\" maps to P161, so that's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select all ?film where P57 (director) is Q43203 (Clint Eastwood) and P161 (starring) is also Q43203.\n\nI should also make sure that the variables and prefixes are correctly used. So, \"?film\" as the variable for the film URI, \"wdt:\" for the property prefixes, and the correct entities.\n\nFinally, it's important to validate. I think this query makes sense because it's mirroring the DBpedia query's structure but with Wikidata's syntax and identifiers. I don't see any immediate errors in the logic or syntax.\n</think>\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata retrieves films where Clint Eastwood is both the director and an actor by mapping DBpedia relations to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film WHERE {\n  ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q43203 ;\n        wdt:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n</sparql>"

The user already has a DBpedia query, and I have the mappings from ER2 to translate DBpedia entities and relations into Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the DBpedia query they provided: \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_African_CFA_franc> }\n\nThis query is selecting all URIs where the 'currency' property is set to 'West African CFA franc'. So the key entities here are the 'currency' property and the 'West African CFA franc' resource.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings:\n- The DBpedia property <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency> maps to Wikidata's P38.\n- The DBpedia resource <http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_African_CFA_franc> maps to Wikidata's Q861690.\n\nSo in Wikidata, I need to find all entities that have the property P38 (currency) with the value Q861690 (West African CFA franc).\n\nNow, thinking about how to structure the SPARQL query in Wikidata. In Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different from DBpedia. Instead of using angle brackets for IRIs, we prefix them with 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties.\n\nSo, the property P38 in Wikidata can be represented as wd:P38. The value Q861690 is wd:Q861690.\n\nThe query should select distinct items where the 'currency' (P38) is the 'West African CFA franc' (Q861690). So in Wikidata, the query would look for any item that has P38 set to Q861690.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query as:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P38 wd:Q861690\n}\n\nI think that's correct, but to make sure, I'll check if there are any nuances in Wikidata's querying that I might have missed. For example, sometimes it's necessary to use 'ps:' for properties if you're dealing with qualifiers, but in this case, it's a straightforward property statement, so 'wdt:' should suffice.\n\nAlso, ensuring that P38 is indeed the correct property for 'currency' in Wikidata. Looking it up, P38 is 'currency', so that's accurate.\n\nSo, the final query should select all items (countries) that have their currency as the West African CFA franc in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo find out in which countries the West African CFA franc is used, we map the DBpedia query to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. \n\n**Key Mapping Steps:**\n1. **DBpedia Property to Wikidata Property:**\n   - DBpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency>\n   - Wikidata: P38\n\n2. **DBpedia Resource to Wikidata Item:**\n   - DBpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_African_CFA_franc>\n   - Wikidata: Q861690\n\n**Wikidata SPARQL Query:**\nThe query selects all items (countries) that use the West African CFA franc as their currency.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P38 wd:Q861690\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the original question is asking for the population of Iraq. The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia that uses the dbo:populationTotal predicate. They also provided an entity and relation mapping (ER2) that connects DBpedia entities to Wikidata entities.\n\nLooking at the ER2, I see that dbr:Iraq in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities: Q796 and Q3041595. I know Q796 is the main entity for Iraq, so that's the one I'll use. \n\nNext, the DBpedia ontology property dbo:populationTotal maps to Wikidata's P1082. So, I need to replace dbo:populationTotal with wdt:P1082 in Wikidata syntax.\n\nNow, in Wikidata, the query structure uses PREFIX wd: for entity URIs and PREFIX wdt: for property URIs. So, I'll set up the prefixes accordingly.\n\nThe original DBpedia query selects ?pIraq where dbr:Iraq has the populationTotal property. Translating that to Wikidata, I'll select ?population where wd:Q796 has the wdt:P1082 property.\n\nI should also name the variable appropriately, so I'll use ?population instead of ?pIraq for clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should fetch the population value of Iraq using the mapped properties and entities.\n\nI think that's all.

The original query is asking for all holidays by selecting distinct URIs where the type is dbo:Holiday. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER2 mappings provided. It shows that DBpedia's \"Holiday\" is mapped to Wikidata's Q1445650. So in Wikidata, the concept of a holiday is represented by that specific item.\n\nNow, I need to construct the equivalent query in Wikidata's SPARQL. In Wikidata, items are often queried using their QID, and types are usually determined using wdt:P31. So instead of rdf:type and dbo:Holiday, I'll use wdt:P31 and wd:Q1445650.\n\nPutting this together, the query should select distinct items where their type (P31) is Holiday (Q1445650). So the WHERE clause will have ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes for Wikidata, like PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nLet me double-check if I'm using the right syntax. Since we're just looking for items of type Holiday, the query seems straightforward. No need for additional filters or triples here.\n\nSo, the final query should select all distinct ?item where ?item is a Holiday in Wikidata. That should give the list of holidays celebrated around the world as per the user's question.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we'll map the DBpedia concepts and relationships to their Wikidata equivalents using the ER2 mappings provided. The query will aim to retrieve all holidays in Wikidata.\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** `dbo:Holiday` in DBpedia\n   - **Mapping:** `dbo:Holiday` maps to `wikidata:Q1445650` (Holiday in Wikidata)\n   - **SPARQL Query Pattern:** We are looking for all resources of type `dbo:Holiday` in DBpedia.\n\n2. **Analyze the Query Structure:**\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves all URIs where the resource is of type `dbo:Holiday`.\n   - In Wikidata, the equivalent property for `rdf:type` is `wdt:P31`, and the equivalent resource for `dbo:Holiday` is `wd:Q1445650`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - We will use `wdt:P31` (instance of) to define the type relationship.\n   - Filter the results to include only resources of type `wd:Q1445650` (Holiday).\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\n PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\n SELECT DISTINCT ?item\n WHERE\n {\n   ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650\n }\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct items in Wikidata that are classified as holidays, equivalent to the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's data model and syntax."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so the user is asking for a SPARQL query on Wikidata to find which Greek parties are pro-European. They provided a similar query for DBpedia and some mappings. Let me figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original query, it's selecting URIs where the entity is a PoliticalParty from Greece with the ideology Pro-Europeanism. So, I need to map each part of this query to Wikidata.\n\nStarting with the entity, in DBpedia it's a PoliticalParty, which maps to Wikidata's Q7278. So in Wikidata, I'll use wd:Q7278.\n\nNext, the country is Greece. In DBpedia, Greece is a resource, and in Wikidata, it's Q41. So the country relation in DBpedia (ontology:country) maps to Wikidata's P17, which stands for 'country'. So I'll use p:P17 and the value wd:Q41.\n\nNow, the ideology is Pro-Europeanism. DBpedia's ontology/ideology maps to Wikidata's P1142, and the resource is Pro-Europeanism, which maps to Q3781399 or Q1377153. I think using Q3781399 is more precise here.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure should mimic the DBpedia query but with Wikidata syntax. So, I'll select distinct ?item where it's a political party, country is Greece, and ideology is Pro-Europeanism.\n\nI should double-check if these mappings are correct. PoliticalParty to Q7278 seems right. P17 for country, and Q41 for Greece is correct. P1142 is for ideology, and Q3781399 for Pro-Europeanism looks accurate.\n\nSo the final query should be selecting ?item where it's instance of Q7278, has country P17 with Q41, and has ideology P1142 with Q3781399. That should give the desired results without errors.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), we need to map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **PoliticalParty**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty` \u2192 `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7278`\n   - **Country**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country` \u2192 `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17`\n   - **Greece**: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece` \u2192 `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41`\n   - **Ideology**: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ideology` \u2192 `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1142`\n   - **Pro-Europeanism**: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pro-Europeanism` \u2192 `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3781399`\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata properties and entities identified above.\n   - Maintain the same query structure as the DBpedia query but with Wikidata syntax.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE \n{ \n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q7278 ;  # Entity is a political party\n    wdt:P17 wd:Q41 ;       # Country is Greece\n    wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399  # Ideology is Pro-Europeanism\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to get the birthdays of all the actors from the TV show Charmed. Let me start by understanding what the original DBpedia query does.\n\nThe original query is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charmed> <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> ?actor . ?actor <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthDate> ?date }\n\nBreaking it down, it selects the distinct birth dates of actors who star in Charmed.\n\nNow, I have the entity and relation mappings from ER2. Let me see:\n\n1. The resource for Charmed in DBpedia is mapped to Q162371 in Wikidata.\n2. The 'starring' property in DBpedia (dbpedia.org/ontology/starring) is mapped to Wikidata's P161.\n3. The 'birthDate' property in DBpedia is mapped to P569 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to translate the original query into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, we use the prefix wd: for entities and p: or ps: for properties. Also, when using qualifiers, we might need to handle the structure differently.\n\nIn the original query, the remember to use DISTINCT because an actor might have multiple birth dates in the data, but we want each only once.\n\nPutting it together, I want to find all actors (p:P161) of Charmed (wd:Q162371) and their birth dates (p:P569). So the WHERE clause will have two triples: one linking Charmed to the actor, and the other linking the actor to their birth date.\n\nI think the correct structure would be:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE {\n  wd:Q162371 p:P161 ?actor .\n  ?actor wdt:P569 ?date .\n}\n\nWait, Wikidata's property for 'starring' is P161, and it's a property that links the work to the actor, so that part is correct. For birth dates, P569 is the correct property in Wikidata, and using wdt:P569 should give the actual date values.\n\nI should double-check if using p:P161 requires any qualifiers, but I think for this case, we just need a simple triple. So, I'll construct the query as above.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: The task is to retrieve the birth dates of actors from the TV show Charmed.\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata**:\n   - Charmed's resource: Q162371.\n   - Starring property: P161.\n   - Birth date property: P569.\n\n3. **Construct the Query**: Using Wikidata syntax, with DISTINCT to avoid duplicates, selecting the date variable.\n\n4. **SPARQL Query**: Combine the resources and properties into the correct structure.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE {\n    wd:Q162371 p:P161 ?actor .\n    ?actor wdt:P569 ?date .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to convert the given SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. Let's start by understanding what the original query does.\n\nThe original query is asking for the artistic movement that the painter of \"The Three Dancers\" belongs to. It uses DBpedia's ontology, so the query has the following parts:\n\n- It selects the URI of the movement.\n- It finds \"The Three Dancers\" resource.\n- It gets the author of that work.\n- Then it finds the movement associated with that author.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings:\n\n1. The Three Dancers in DBpedia is mapped to Q3235867 in Wikidata.\n2. The 'author' property (dbo:author) in DBpedia is mapped to P50 in Wikidata.\n3. The 'movement' property (dbo:movement) in DBpedia is mapped to P135 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to translate all these parts into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, the prefixes are usually 'wd' and 'wds' for entities and statements respectively.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll define the prefixes. Instead of 'dbo' and 'res', I'll use 'wd' for the entities and maybe 'wds' if I need to access statements.\n\nNext, in the WHERE clause:\n\n- Instead of 'res:The_Three_Dancers', I'll use 'wd:Q3235867'.\n- The 'dbo:author' becomes 'wds:P50'.\n- The 'dbo:movement' becomes 'wds:P135'.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the movement URI where The Three Dancers (Q3235867) has an author, who in turn has a movement.\n\nI also need to make sure that 'movement' is represented correctly in Wikidata as P135. So the structure should remain similar, but with Wikidata's URIs and properties.\n\nI should double-check if there are any nuances in Wikidata's data model that might affect the query. For example, sometimes properties have different conventions or might require the use of qualifiers, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll write the final SPARQL query using these mappings.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we need to map the entities and properties using the provided ER2 mappings and adjust the syntax accordingly.\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - The painting: \"The Three Dancers\"\n   - Relation: \"author\"\n   - Relation: \"movement\"\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata:**\n   - \"The Three Dancers\" in DBpedia maps to `wd:Q3235867` in Wikidata.\n   - \"author\" (`dbo:author`) maps to `wds:P50`.\n   - \"movement\" (`dbo:movement`) maps to `wds:P135`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query in Wikidata Syntax:**\n   - Use `wd:` for entities.\n   - Use `wds:` for property paths.\n   - Maintain the same structure, adjusting for Wikidata's syntax.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    wd:Q3235867 wds:P50 ?person .\n    ?person wds:P135 ?uri .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the artistic movement (`?uri`) associated with the author (`?person`) of \"The Three Dancers\" in Wikidata."

Their SPARQL query is over DBpedia, and they want to convert this to a query over Wikidata using the provided mappings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the original SPARQL query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the URI is an Actor and either has a direct birthPlace of Germany or has a birthPlace that is in Germany via the country relation. So the structure is about actors and their birthplace.\n\nLooking at the mappings provided, the DBpedia Actor is mapped to Wikidata's Q33999. So in Wikidata, we'll be looking for entities with the instance Q33999. Next, the birthPlace in DBpedia is P19 in Wikidata. Lastly, Germany is mapped to a few QIDs, primarily Q183 being the country.\n\nNow, the original query uses a UNION to handle both direct and indirect birthplace relations. In Wikidata, the birthPlace property can directly link to the country, so the UNION might not be necessary. Alternatively, we can structure it as a single condition checking if the birthPlace is Germany.\n\nSo, the main components are:\n- Selecting distinct items where the item is an actor (wd:Q33999)\n- And has a birthPlace (p:P19) that is Germany (wd:Q183)\n\nI should construct the query to first find all items of type Actor, then link their birthPlace to Germany. Also, considering that sometimes birthPlace might be a more specific location, but since the original query includes both direct and country-level, Wikidata's structure handles this inherently.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should be straightforward, selecting items that are instances of Actor and have their birthPlace set to Germany.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Key Entities and Relations\n- **Actor**: Identified by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Actor`\n- **birthPlace**: Identified by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace`\n- **Germany**: Identified by `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany`\n\n### Step 2: Map to Wikidata\n- **Actor**: Mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q33999`\n- **birthPlace**: Mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P19`\n- **country**: Mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17`\n\n### Step 3: Equivalent Properties in Wikidata\n- **Actor**: `wd:Q33999`\n- **birthPlace**: `p:P19`\n- **Germany**: `wd:Q183`\n\n### Step 4: Construct the SPARQL Query\nThe original query structure in DBpedia is:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Actor>\n  {\n    ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany>\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace> ?place .\n    ?place <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn Wikidata, we can simplify this query by using the `p` and `ps` prefixes for properties.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q33999 .\n  ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q183 .\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- `SELECT DISTINCT ?item`: Selects distinct items.\n- `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q33999`: Filters items that are instances of Actor.\n- `?item wdt:P19 wd:Q183`: Filters items that have Germany as their birthplace.\n\nThis query retrieves all actors born in Germany according to Wikidata.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q33999 .\n  ?item wdt:P19 wd:Q183 .\n}\n</sparql>"

I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that answers the question \"Who designed the Brooklyn Bridge?\" using the provided mappings.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the entities and relations in the question. The main entity is the Brooklyn Bridge, and the relation is \"designed by,\" which in the DBpedia context is represented as 'dbo:architect'.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource for Brooklyn Bridge maps to Wikidata's Q125006, and the DBpedia ontology 'architect' (dbo:architect) maps to Wikidata's property P84 (architect).\n\nNext, I analyze the SPARQL structure from DBpedia. The original query selects the URI of the architect using a straightforward pattern: Brooklyn_Bridge --> architect --> ?uri.\n\nNow, I'll translate this into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, entities are referenced by their Q numbers, and properties are referenced by their P numbers. So, the Brooklyn Bridge is Q125006, and the property we're interested in is P84.\n\nConstructing the query, I'll use the PREFIX to define the wikidata namespace. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll state that Q125006 has the property P84, and bind the object to ?uri.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the syntax is correct and that the query logic aligns with how Wikidata structures its data. This includes using 'wd' as the prefix for entities and 'p' followed by the property number.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the architect's URI from Wikidata, mirroring the structure of the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's specific identifiers and syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo form the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we'll use the mapped entities and relationships:\n\n- The Brooklyn Bridge in DBpedia (`res:Brooklyn_Bridge`) maps to Wikidata's `wd:Q125006`.\n- The architect relationship in DBpedia (`dbo:architect`) maps to Wikidata's property `wdt:P84`.\n\nThe query will follow the pattern:\n- Brooklyn Bridge (Q125006) is linked through the `P84` property to the architect's URI.\n\nHere is the SPRQL query for KG2:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q125006 wdt:P84 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the URI of the architect of the Brooklyn Bridge from Wikidata.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> \nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n    wd:Q125006 wdt:P84 ?uri \n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out who composed the Game of Thrones theme. I know the DBpedia query does this by selecting a URI where Game of Thrones has a composer. \n\nFirst, I need to map the entities from DBpedia to Wikidata. From the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource for Game of Thrones is linked to Wikidata's Q23572. The composer property in DBpedia is P86 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I should structure the Wikidata query similarly. Instead of using DBpedia's ontology and resource prefixes, I'll use the Wikidata prefixes, which are usually wd: and wdt:. The query should select the composers of Q23572.\n\nI remember that in SPARQL, prefixes help abbreviate the URIs. So I'll define PREFIXes for Wikidata. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll use Q23572 and the P86 property to find the composer.\n\nLet me make sure I'm using the correct syntax. The property for composer is wdt:P86, and the subject is wd:Q23572. I'll select ?composer where this triple exists.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should start with the prefixes, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause with the specific resource and property.\n\nI think I've got it. Let me double-check the syntax to ensure there are no errors. Maybe run it in a SPARQL editor if possible, but in this case, I'll write it out as instructed.\n</think>\n\nTo find out who composed the Game of Thrones theme using Wikidata, we can construct a SPARQL query by mapping the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Resource (Game of Thrones):** In DBpedia, it's `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Game_of_Thrones`. In Wikidata, this is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23572`.\n   - **Relation (composer):** In DBpedia, this is `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/composer`. In Wikidata, the equivalent property is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P86`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata prefixes `wd:` and `wdt:` for resources and properties respectively.\n   - Select the composer (`?composer`) where the resource `wd:Q23572` (Game of Thrones) has property `wdt:P86` (composer).\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?composer\nWHERE {\n    wd:Q23572 wdt:P86 ?composer.\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the composer(s) of Game of Thrones from Wikidata."

It's selecting distinct URIs where the URI is of type Film and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The prefixes are for DBpedia's ontology and resources. \n\nThe ER mappings show that 'dbo:Film' corresponds to 'wd:Q11424', which is Film in Wikidata. Then 'dbo:director' maps to 'wd:P57', which is 'director' in Wikidata. Finally, Francis Ford Coppola in DBpedia maps to 'wd:Q56094' in Wikidata.\n\nSo, to construct the Wikidata query, I need to use the Wikidata prefixes 'wd' and 'wdv'. The structure should be similar: select distinct items where the item is an instance of Film, and the director is Coppola. \n\nI think the Wikidata syntax uses 'wdv:' for qualifiers, but since this is a simple triple, I can just use 'wd:P57'.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to convert this DBpedia SPARQL query into one that works with Wikidata. First, I need to understand what the original query is doing. It's looking for the first album by Queen. \n\nThe query uses 'dbo:Album' as the type, 'dbo:artist' to specify Queen, and 'dbo:releaseDate' to order the results by date. It's selecting the URI of the album and ordering them by release date in ascending order, then taking the first one.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I can map each DBpedia element to its corresponding Wikidata element. 'dbo:Album' maps to 'Q482994', which is 'album' in Wikidata. 'dbo:artist' maps to 'P175', which is 'performer' in Wikidata. The entity for Queen is 'Q15862', and 'dbo:releaseDate' maps to 'P577', which is 'publication date' in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the structure will be similar. I'll need to select the item where it's an instance of album, performed by Queen, and get their publication dates. Then, I'll sort them by publication date and take the first one.\n\nOne thing I need to watch out for is the syntax differences between DBpedia and Wikidata. Wikidata uses 'wd:' as the prefix for entities, and the properties are 'p:' followed by the ID, but usually, you use 'ps:' for statements. Also, for ordering, I might need to use 'xsd:dateTime' for the date comparison.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the query by first declaring the prefixes, then selecting the item and its publication date. I'll filter by type using 'wd:Q482994', set the performer to 'wd:Q15862', and order by the publication date in ascending order, limiting to the first one.\n\nI should double-check if 'P577' directly corresponds to release date or if there's a more appropriate property, but from the ER2, 'P577' is mapped to 'dbo:releaseDate', so it should be correct.\n\nFinally, I'll write the SPARQL query using these mappings, ensuring that the syntax aligns with Wikidata's requirements.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the given DBpedia SPARQL query into a Wikidata SPARQL query for the same purpose, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify and Map Entities and Relations:**\n   - DBpedia `dbo:Album` maps to Wikidata `wd:Q482994`.\n   - DBpedia `dbo:artist` maps to Wikidata property `p:P175`.\n   - DBpedia resource `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_(band)>` maps to Wikidata item `wd:Q15862`.\n   - DBpedia `dbo:releaseDate` maps to Wikidata property `p:P577`.\n\n2. **Understand the Query Structure:**\n   The original query retrieves the earliest album by Queen based on the release date. We replicate this logic in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `wikidata:Q482994` for the album type.\n   - Use `wdt:P175` to specify the artist.\n   - Retrieve `pwd:Q577` for the publication (release) date.\n   - Order results by publication date and return the earliest one.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ;\n        wdt:P175 wd:Q15862 ;\n        wdt:P577 ?date .\n\n  SERVICE wikibase:label {\n    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" .\n  }\n\n}\nORDER BY ?date\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the earliest album by Queen using Wikidata's syntax and properties, ensuring it aligns with the desired outcome."

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the currency of the Czech Republic, given that I have some mappings from DBpedia to Wikidata. Let me break this down as if I'm explaining it to myself.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the original DBpedia query. It's using two prefixes: dbo for the DBpedia ontology and res for the resources. The query selects distinct URIs where the Czech Republic (res:Czech_Republic) has the property dbo:currency. So, essentially, it's looking for whatever resource is linked via the currency property from the Czech Republic in DBpedia.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia entities to their Wikidata equivalents using the ER2 provided. Looking at the ER2 mappings, I see that:\n- The DBpedia resource for Czech Republic (res:Czech_Republic) maps to Wikidata's Q213.\n- The DBpedia ontology property for currency (dbo:currency) maps to Wikidata's property P38.\n\nAlright, so in Wikidata, the Czech Republic is represented by Q213, and the property for currency is P38. The goal is to find the value of P38 for Q213.\n\nNext, I should consider how SPARQL works in Wikidata. Typically, in Wikidata, entities are referenced by their Q numbers with the prefix wd:, and properties are referenced by their P numbers with the prefix wdt:. So, to query the currency of the Czech Republic in Wikidata, I would need to write a query that starts with the entity Q213 and follows the P38 relation.\n\nI need to structure the query correctly. In SPARQL, I'll start with PREFIX declarations for the namespaces. Usually, wd: is the prefix for entities, and wdt: is for properties. However, sometimes people use different prefixes, but it's standard to map wd to wikidata.org/entity/ and wdt to wikidata.org/prop/direct/.\n\nSo, the query should select the value of the currency property for the Czech Republic. That would involve writing something like:\nSELECT ?currency WHERE { wd:Q213 wdt:P38 ?currency }\n\nWait, but in the original DBpedia query, there was a WHERE clause that links the subject to the object via a property. So, I should make sure that the subject is Q213 and the predicate is P38, and the object is the variable we're selecting, which would be the currency.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata would start with the necessary prefixes, though in practice, many endpoints allow using the prefixes without explicit declaration. But to be safe, including them is better.\n\nSo, including the prefixes, it should look like:\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?currency \nWHERE { \n    wd:Q213 wdt:P38 ?currency \n}\n\nI should also consider if there are any specifics in Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint, like the need for a default graph or any particular syntax requirements, but usually, for direct properties, the above should suffice.\n\nTo validate, I can think: Does Q213 represent the Czech Republic in Wikidata? Yes. Does P38 represent the currency property? Yes, as per the mapping. So the query should return the correct currency, which I believe is the Czech koruna.\n\nI don't think there are any complications like multiple currencies or historical changes unless the endpoint is configured to handle historical data, but that's beyond the current scope. The query seems straightforward and should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo find the currency of the Czech Republic in Wikidata, we'll construct a SPARQL query using the mapped entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata. The Czech Republic is represented by Q213, and the currency property is P38.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?currency \nWHERE { \n    wd:Q213 wdt:P38 ?currency \n}\n```\n\nThis query selects the currency of the Czech Republic from Wikidata."

The original query is asking for all people born in Vienna who died in Berlin. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct URIs where each URI has both a birthPlace of Vienna and a deathPlace of Berlin. The properties used are dbpedia's birthPlace and deathPlace, and the resources are Vienna and Berlin.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that birthPlace in DBpedia corresponds to P19 in Wikidata, and deathPlace is P20. Vienna in DBpedia maps to Q1741 in Wikidata. Berlin in DBpedia has multiple Wikidata entries: Q64, Q31910788, Q56036, and Q56037.\n\nNow, I need to construct the Wikidata query. In Wikidata, entities are referenced by their Q numbers, like Q1741 for Vienna. For Berlin, since there are multiple entries, I should include all of them to cover all possibilities, but maybe just the main one like Q64 is sufficient. Wait, the user included all, so perhaps I should include them all in the query.\n\nIn Wikidata, the query structure is slightly different. Instead of using rdf:type, we just use the properties directly. So, I'll need to filter where birthPlace is Vienna (P19:Q1741) and deathPlace is any of the Berlin entities.\n\nPutting it together, the query should select distinct items where item.P19 = Q1741 and item.P20 is one of the Berlin QIDs. I'll list all the Berlin QIDs provided to ensure all possibilities are covered.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. In Wikidata, we use FILTER NOT EXISTS to handle optional properties sometimes, but here, since both birth and death places are required, I just need to list the conditions with &&.\n\nSo, I'll write the query using SELECT DISTINCT, then define ?item with the two conditions, and list all the Berlin QIDs separated by commas within the IN function.\n\nI should also test the query in my mind to see if it makes sense. It should fetch all items where P19 is Vienna and P20 is any of the Berlin entities. That should correctly mirror the DBpedia query but in Wikidata's structure.\n\nFinally, I'll format the query correctly, making sure the syntax is correct with semicolons and brackets where necessary.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the DBpedia SPARQL query into Wikidata's SPARQL, I will rely on the provided ER2 mappings to align the entities and relations accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Query Pattern:**\n   - The DBpedia query selects all URIs that have both `birthPlace` set to Vienna and `deathPlace` set to Berlin.\n\n2. **Map DBpedia Entities to Wikidata:**\n   - `birthPlace` in DBpedia maps to `P19` in Wikidata.\n   - `deathPlace` in DBpedia maps to `P20` in Wikidata.\n   - Vienna (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna`) maps to `Q1741` in Wikidata.\n   - Berlin (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin`) can map to multiple entities in Wikidata (`Q64`, `Q31910788`, `Q56036`, `Q56037`).\n\n3. **Construct the Wikidata Query:**\n   - Utilize the `SELECT DISTINCT` clause to avoid duplicate results.\n   - Use `FILTER` to ensure items have both `P19` and `P20` properties.\n   - Specify the values for `P19` (Vienna) and allow `P20` to match any of the Berlin entities.\n   - Use the `IN` operator to include all possible Berlin entities.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE \n{\n    ?item p:P19 ?birthPlace;\n          p:P20 ?deathPlace.\n    FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item p:P19/pwdt:P214 ?birthPlace_ }\n    FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?item p:P20/pwdt:P214 ?deathPlace_ }\n    FILTER(EXISTS { ?item p:P19/psdt:P569 ?birthTime })\n    FILTER(EXISTS { ?item p:P20/psdt:P570 ?deathTime })\n    BIND(wd:Q1741 AS ?birthPlace)\n    VALUES ?deathPlace { wd:Q64 wd:Q31910788 wd:Q56036 wd:Q56037 }\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all items in Wikidata that have both a birthplace of Vienna (`Q1741`) and a deathplace corresponding to any of the Berlin entities (`Q64`, `Q31910788`, `Q56036`, `Q56037`)."

I'll select distinct items where the item is an instance of bridge (using Q12280), and it crosses the Seine (using P177). I'll filter the Seine by both its Wikidata IDs to ensure I get all relevant bridges.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should be in Wikidata's syntax, using PREFIXes for easier reading. I'll structure the WHERE clause to include the type, the property, and the value. Then, I'll validate to make sure I'm using the correct properties and that the query logic makes sense. That should do it.\n</think>\n\nLet's generate the SPARQL query for Wikidata step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations in the Question**:  \n   - Entity: Bridges  \n   - Relation: Crosses  \n   - Target: Seine  \n\n2. **Map DBpedia Entities to Wikidata**:  \n   - Bridge (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Bridge>`) \u2192 `wd:Q12280`  \n   - Crosses (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/crosses>`) \u2192 `p:P177`  \n   - Seine (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine>`) \u2192 `wd:Q1471` and `wd:Q1142326`  \n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:  \n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?bridge\n   WHERE {\n       ?bridge wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 .  # Bridge is an instance of Bridge\n       ?bridge p:P177 ?crosses .     # Crosses some object\n       FILTER(wd:Q1471 = ?crosses || wd:Q1142326 = ?crosses)\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This query retrieves all distinct bridges that cross the Seine River.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**:  \n1. **PREFIX Definitions**:  \n   - `wdt` is used for direct property access.  \n   - `wd` is used for entity access.  \n\n2. **Query Structure**:  \n   - `SELECT DISTINCT ?bridge`: Retrieve unique bridges.  \n   - `?bridge wdt:P31 wd:Q12280`: Filters for items that are bridges.  \n   - `?bridge p:P177 ?crosses`: Finds what the bridge crosses.  \n   - `FILTER(wd:Q1471 = ?crosses || wd:Q1142326 = ?crosses)`: Ensures the crossed entity is the Seine.  \n\n3. **Filtering for Seine**:  \n   - Includes both `Q1471` and `Q1142326` to capture all Seine references.  \n\n**Final SPARQL Query**:  \n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?bridge\nWHERE {\n    ?bridge wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 .\n    ?bridge p:P177 ?crosses .\n    FILTER(wd:Q1471 = ?crosses || wd:Q1142326 = ?crosses)\n}\n```\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?bridge\nWHERE {\n    ?bridge wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 .\n    ?bridge p:P177 ?crosses .\n    FILTER(wd:Q1471 = ?crosses || wd:Q1142326 = ?crosses)\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so the user is asking me to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on an existing DBpedia query. The original query is about finding which musician wrote the most books. Let's break down what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original query. It's selecting URIs where the occupation is Musician, and they have authored books. Then it's ordering by the count of books they've authored. So, the main goal is to translate this query into Wikidata's syntax.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that each part of the DBpedia query has equivalents in Wikidata. The occupation property in DBpedia maps to P106 in Wikidata. Musician as a resource in DBpedia is Q639669 in Wikidata. The author property in DBpedia is P50 in Wikidata, and Book is Q571.\n\nSo, I need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata using these mappings. I should start by selecting the musician, then filter for those who have authored books. I'll need to count the number of books each musician has written and order them in descending order.\n\nIn Wikidata, the way to structure this would be to use the 'wd:' prefix for entities and 'p:' and 'ps:' for properties. The query needs to group by the musician and count the books. Then I'll limit it to one result.\n\nI should make sure that I'm using the right syntax. So, I'll use GROUP BY and COUNT, then ORDER BY and LIMIT. Wait, in Wikidata, I think I need to use HAVING as well, but I think COUNT is enough here.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the query to select the musician, count their books, order by that count, and return the top result. I also need to ensure that the variables are correctly bound and the syntax is correct for Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint.\n\nLet me double-check if I'm using the right prefixes and properties. Yes, replacing 'p:' with 'ps:' for the property and 'pt:' for the property type. So, 'ps:P50' is the author, and 'wd:Q571' is the book.\n\nAlright, I think that's all. Time to draft the query and make sure it's valid.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation and the final SPARQL query:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entities**: Musician, Book, and the author relationship.\n   - **Relations**: occupation (Musician), author (linking to books).\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata**:\n   - `dbpedia:occupation` \u2192 `wikidata:P106`\n   - `dbpedia:Musician` \u2192 `wikidata:Q639669`\n   - `dbpedia:author` \u2192 `wikidata:P50`\n   - `dbpedia:Book` \u2192 `wikidata:Q571`\n\n3. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Select the musician (`?musician`).\n   - Filter by occupation being Musician.\n   - Count the books authored by each musician.\n   - Order by the count of books in descending order.\n   - Limit the result to 1.\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata would look like this:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?musician (COUNT(?book) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n    ?musician wdt:P106/wdt:Q639669.\n    ?book wdt:P50 ?musician.\n    ?book wdt:P31 wd:Q571.\n}\nGROUP BY ?musician\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\n**Final Query**:\n```sparql\nSELECT ?musician (COUNT(?book) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n    ?musician wdt:P106/wdt:Q639669.\n    ?book wdt:P50 ?musician.\n    ?book wdt:P31 wd:Q571.\n}\nGROUP BY ?musician\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```"

The original query is asking for television shows created by John Cleese. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the DBpedia query uses a few key components: it's selecting URIs of Television Shows that have a creator relationship with John Cleese. The query looks like this:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TelevisionShow> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cleese> }\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia elements to their equivalents in Wikidata using the provided 'er2' mappings.\n\n1. **TelevisionShow**: In DBpedia, this is `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/TelevisionShow`, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15416` in Wikidata.\n2. **Creator**: The DBpedia property `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P170` in Wikidata.\n3. **John Cleese**: His DBpedia resource is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Cleese`, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25014` in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I need to structure the SPARQL query in Wikidata syntax. In Wikidata, the 'a' keyword is replaced with `wdt:P31` for 'instance of', and properties are prefixed with `wd:` for the entity and `pq:` or `ps:` for qualifiers.\n\nSo, the query should select items where the item is an instance of Television Show (P31:Q15416) and has a creator (P170) John Cleese (Q25014).\n\nPutting it all together, the query becomes:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 ;\n         wdt:P170 wd:Q25014\n}\n\nI think this should correctly retrieve all television shows created by John Cleese from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed by mapping DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The goal is to find all writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. \n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature> }\n\nSo, the query is selecting entities that are of type Writer and have received the Nobel Prize in Literature award.\n\nNow, I need to map the DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. Let's go through each part:\n\n1. **Writer**: In the ER2, the DBpedia ontology Writer (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer) maps to Wikidata's Q36180. So, in Wikidata, the entity for a writer is Q36180. But in SPARQL, we use the property to denote type, which is P31, and the value is Q36180.\n\n2. **Award**: The award relation in DBpedia is http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award, which maps to Wikidata's P166. So, in Wikidata, we use P166 to indicate that an item has received an award.\n\n3. **Nobel Prize in Literature**: The DBpedia resource http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature maps to Wikidata's Q37922.\n\nPutting this together, the Wikidata query should find all items that have the type Writer (P31:Q36180) and have received the award (P166) of Nobel Prize in Literature (Q37922).\n\nIn SPARQL for Wikidata, we start with PREFIX to define the namespace. Then, we use the V\u0161ech DATA space. The query structure would be:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n        wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if I missed anything. The 'wdt' is used because it's for direct triples in the Wikidata database, which is correct for these simple statements. Also, using 'SELECT DISTINCT' ensures we get unique entries. I don't see any immediate issues, so this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings and structure the query accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity**: Writers (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer)\n   - **Relation**: Award (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award)\n   - **Target Award**: Nobel Prize in Literature (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature)\n\n2. **Map Entities and Relations to Wikidata:**\n   - **Writer**: Mapped to Q36180\n   - **Award**: Mapped to P166\n   - **Nobel Prize in Literature**: Mapped to Q37922\n\n3. **Construct Wikidata Query:**\n   - Use `wdt:P31` for type (Writer)\n   - Use `wdt:P166` for award received\n   - Select all items with these properties.\n   - Ensure to use `SELECT DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n        wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original question is \"Who discovered Ceres?\" The DBpedia SPARQL query provided is:\n\n```\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)> dbo:discoverer ?uri \n}\n```\n\nThis query is looking for the discoverer of Ceres using DBpedia's ontology.\n\nLooking at the Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2), I see that:\n\n- The DBpedia entity for Ceres is mapped to Wikidata's Q596.\n- The DBpedia property 'discoverer' is mapped to Wikidata's P61.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the entity for Ceres is Q596, and the property 'discoverer' is P61.\n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, properties are used differently than in DBpedia. Instead of a prefix like 'dbo:', I can directly use the property IDs with 'wd:' as the prefix.\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nSELECTDISTINCT ?discoverer WHERE { wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?discoverer }\n\nBreaking it down:\n- `wd:Q596` is the Wikidata entity for Ceres.\n- `wdt:P61` is the property for 'discoverer' in Wikidata.\n- `?discoverer` is the variable that will hold the value of the discoverer.\n\nI need to ensure that the syntax is correct for Wikidata. The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause is used to retrieve unique values. The `WHERE` clause defines the triple pattern to match.\n\nI don't see any need for additional prefixes or complex queries here since it's a straightforward property lookup.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query should correctly fetch the discoverer of Ceres from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nThe SPARQL query to find who discovered Ceres in Wikidata uses the mapped entity and property from the ER2. Here's the constructed query:\n\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT ?discoverer \nWHERE \n{\n  wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?discoverer\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the discoverer of Ceres (Q596) using the P61 property in Wikidata.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?discoverer \nWHERE \n{\n  wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?discoverer\n}\n</sparql>"

Let me break down what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original DBpedia query:\n- It selects distinct URIs where the occupation is Bandleader and the instrument is Trumpet.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided:\n- The DBpedia occupation property maps to Wikidata's P106.\n- Bandleader in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities: Q5280538 and Q806349. I guess I can use both to cover all possibilities.\n- The instrument property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P1303.\n- Trumpet in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities: Q119621 and Q8338. Again, I'll include both.\n\nNow, I need to convert the DBpedia query into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, we typically use theWD namespace for properties and wdt for data types. So, the occupation property becomes wdt:P106, and the instrument becomes wdt:P1303.\n\nSince the Bandleader has two possible Wikidata entities, I should include both in the query using the UNION keyword to handle multiple possibilities. The same goes for Trumpet having two entities.\n\nPutting it all together, my triple patterns should be:\n- ?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader.\n  Then, use UNION to include both Q5280538 and Q806349.\n- ?uri wdt:P1303 ?trumpet.\n  Again, use UNION for Q119621 and Q8338.\n\nI need to make sure the query fetches distinct values to avoid duplicates and uses the correct prefixes for Wikidata.\n\nLet me write the query structure:\n- PREFIX statements for Wikidata.\n- SELECT DISTINCT ?uri to get unique results.\n- Use two UNIONs: one for occupation and one for instrument.\n\nI should test if this structure correctly aligns with Wikidata's data model. It looks like it should work because it follows standard SPARQL syntax and uses the correct properties and entities from the mappings provided.\n\nOkay, I think I have the structure right. Now, just need to format it properly in SPARQL syntax.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve all bandleaders who play the trumpet from Wikidata, the SPARQL query needs to be constructed using the appropriate properties and entities from the ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Understand the original DBpedia query:** It retrieves URIs where occupation is Bandleader and instrument is Trumpet.\n2. **Map DBpedia entities to Wikidata:**\n   - Occupation (DBpedia) \u2192 P106 (Wikidata)\n   - Bandleader (DBpedia) \u2192 Q5280538, Q806349 (Wikidata)\n   - Instrument (DBpedia) \u2192 P1303 (Wikidata)\n   - Trumpet (DBpedia) \u2192 Q119621, Q8338 (Wikidata)\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query:**\n   - Use SELECT DISTINCT to fetch unique URIs.\n   - Include UNION for multiple possible values (Bandleader and Trumpet).\n   - Use the correct prefixes and syntax for Wikidata.\n\n**Final Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE \n{\n  ?uri wdt:P106 [\n    UNION\n    {\n      <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5280538> ;\n      <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q806349>\n    }\n  ] ;\n    wdt:P1303 [\n      UNION\n      {\n        <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q119621> ;\n        <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8338>\n      }\n    ]\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user convert a SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original query. It's selecting distinct URIs where the resource is a BasketballPlayer and has a height greater than 2 meters. The query uses DBpedia's ontology, so I need to map those classes and properties to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, I see that the DBpedia BasketballPlayer class maps to Wikidata's Q3665646. So, in Wikidata, I'll need to use 'wd:' followed by the entity ID. That would be 'wd:Q3665646'. Also, the height property in DBpedia is mapped to P2048 in Wikidata. So, I'll use 'p:P2048' for the property.\n\nNext, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. Wikidata uses a different syntax, so I'll have to adjust accordingly. The structure should be similar: select distinct URIs where each URI has the type BasketballPlayer and has a height property with a value greater than 2.\n\nIn Wikidata, the height property is a quantity, so I should make sure to include the unit. Since the condition is height > 2 meters, I'll use the quantity filter with 2 meters as the value. In SPARQL, it would be something like 'FILTER (?height > \"2\"^^<http://www.wikidata.org/entities/quantity/2780>)' since 2780 corresponds to meters in Wikidata.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct the query using the PREFIX for easier readability. Then define the variables, set the type to BasketballPlayer, link to the height property, and apply the filter.\n\nI should double-check the syntax to make sure it aligns with Wikidata's requirements. Ensuring that the prefixes are correctly used and that the filter is properly formatted with the unit.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations**:\n   - Entity: Basketball players (we're looking for basketball players).\n   - Relation: Height (we're interested in heights greater than 2 meters).\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata using ER2 mappings**:\n   - DBpedia `BasketballPlayer` maps to Wikidata `Q3665646`.\n   - DBpedia `height` maps to Wikidata `P2048`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**:\n   - Use Wikidata syntax and entities from the mappings.\n   - Filter for heights greater than 2 meters.\n\nHere's the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q3665646;\n     p:P2048 ?height.\n  FILTER (?height > \"2\"^^<http://www.wikidata.org/entities/quantity/2780>)\n}\n```\n\n</sparql>"

It's looking for films where both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere starred. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that in DBpedia, the film type is `dbo:Film`, which maps to `Q11424` in Wikidata. So in Wikidata, the entity should be a film, which I think is represented with `wd:Q11424`. Next, the `dbo:starring` property relates the film to the actors, and that maps to `P161` in Wikidata. \n\nNow, the actors: Julia Roberts in DBpedia is `res:Julia_Roberts`, which maps to `Q40523`, and Richard Gere is `res:Richard_Gere`, mapping to `Q48410`. \n\nSo, in the SPARQL query for Wikidata, I need to find items that are films (using `wd:Q11424`), and have both `P161` relations to `Q40523` and `Q48410`. I think using `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424` defines the item as a film. Then, `?item wdt:P161 wd:Q40523` and `?item wdt:P161 wd:Q48410` add the starring conditions. \n\nFinally, I just SELECT the distinct items that satisfy all these conditions. I should make sure to use the correct prefixes in Wikidata and structure the query properly to avoid errors.\n\nHere's how the translated query should look:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424.\n    ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q40523.\n    ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q48410.\n}\n```\nI think that covers all the requirements: identifying the film, connecting it to both actors through the starring property, ensuring it's distinct to avoid duplicates.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the capital of Canada using Wikidata's SPARQL query. First, I remember that in the previous example with DBpedia, the query used the dbo:capital property. Now, I need to map that to Wikidata's equivalent. Looking at the provided ER2 mappings, DBpedia's dbo:capital is mapped to Wikidata's P36. So, that's the property I should use.\n\nNext, the subject in the query is res:Canada, which refers to Canada in DBpedia. In ER2, Canada's DBpedia ID maps to two Wikidata IDs: Q1020 and Q16. So, in Wikidata, I should use wd:Q16 as the subject because that's the correct entity for Canada.\n\nNow, I'll structure the SPARQL query similarly to the DBpedia one, but using Wikidata's prefix and the P36 property. I'll make sure to select distinct to get unique results and ensure the variable ?capital is used correctly.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the query starting with PREFIX, followed by the SELECT statement, and then the WHERE clause with the subject, predicate, and object. I think wd:Q16 is the right entity here. No filters are needed since the question is straightforward, and I believe P36 is the direct equivalent.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any nuances with Wikidata's data model. Sometimes in Wikidata, properties can have multiple values or might need ranking, but in this case, Canada has a single capital, Ottawa. So, I don't think I need to handle multiple values.\n\nAlso, should I include any labels for better readability? The previous example didn't, so I'll stick to just retrieving the URI for the capital.\n\nFinally, I'll validate the syntax to make sure everything is correct. I'll use the wd prefix and the correct syntax for Wikidata SPARQL. Alright, I think that's all.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the Wikidata SPARQL query for finding the capital of Canada:\n\n1.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the capital of Cameroon, just like the example given for DBpedia. Let me break this down step by step because I'm not too familiar with SPARQL or Wikidata, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, I know the question is asking for the capital of Cameroon. In the DBpedia example, they used the query:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { res:Cameroon dbo:capital ?uri }\n\nSo I need to map this over to Wikidata. From the context provided, there's an entity and relation mapping, ER2. It shows that the DBpedia resource for Cameroon is mapped to Wikidata's Q1009, and the DBpedia ontology for capital is mapped to Wikidata's P36.\n\nOkay, so that means in Wikidata, Cameroon is Q1009 and the capital is P36. I remember that in SPARQL, Wikidata uses the 'wd' prefix for entities and 'p' and 'ps' for properties. So I'll need to adjust the prefixes accordingly.\n\nIn the DBpedia query, they're selecting ?uri where res:Cameroon has the dbo:capital relation. Translating that to Wikidata, the structure should be similar: starting with Cameroon (Q1009), then relating via P36 (capital), and selecting the value.\n\nSo I think the SPARQL query would start with PREFIXes for wikidata and rel, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I can just use the standard 'wd' prefix without defining it, but perhaps it's better to include it for clarity, even though SPARQL usually requires defining prefixes unless the endpoint knows them.\n\nWait, no, in the user's example, they prefix dbo and res, so for Wikidata, I should probably define the necessary prefixes. From what I know, Wikidata uses 'wd' for entities, 'wds' for properties, but perhaps 'p' and 'ps' are more commonly used. Let me think. To be safe, I'll use 'wd' for the entity and 'p' for the property.\n\nSo the query would look something like:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1009 p:P36 ?capital\n}\n\nHmm, that seems right, but I'm not sure if 'p:P36' is the correct way. Alternatively, I might have to use 'wdt' for the property. Wait, I think 'wdt' is used for the truthy claims, whereas 'p' might be for the property itself, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no. In SPARQL for Wikidata, to access a property like P36, you use 'wdt:P36'. The 'wdt' is the truthy claim. So perhaps the correct way is to use 'wdt:P36' in the query. Let me check that, but I think that's correct.\n\nSo updating the query:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n\nWait, no. Because 'wdt' is the prefix for the claims. So it's either:\n\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1009> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/declarre/58> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/...>\n\nBut in SPARQL, it's easier to use the prefixes. So I can define 'wd' as the entities, 'wdt' as the claims, and 'wds' perhaps for the property statements.\n\nWait, but in practice, I think most people just use 'wdt' for direct property access. So perhaps the query is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE { wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital }\n\nAlternatively, including the prefixes:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/declarre/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE { wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital }\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me look up how Wikidata's prefixes work. Oh, I think 'wdt' is defined as <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/declarre/>, but that's a bit messy. Maybe it's better to just use the full URIs, but that would make the query longer. Alternatively, I can define the prefixes as needed.\n\nWait, no, in the example, the prefixes were dbo and res, but in Wikidata, perhaps it's better to just write the query without the prefixes since the user's example didn't define them. Wait, no, the user's example for DBpedia did define the prefixes, so maybe I should do the same for Wikidata.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify by just using 'wd' and 'wdt' as the necessary prefixes.\n\nSo, I think the correct SPARQL query would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE {\n  wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n\nAlternatively, including the prefixes, even though many SPARQL endpoints recognize 'wd' and 'wdt' by default, but to be safe, adding the PREFIX lines.\n\nWait, but in the DBpedia example, the user included the PREFIX lines. So I should do the same for Wikidata.\n\nTherefore, the complete SPARQL would be:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/declarre/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE {\n  wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure about 'wdt' vs 'p' vs 'ps'. Alternatively, perhaps using 'p' as the property prefix. Wait, 'p' is for the property, and 'ps' for the property statement (for qualifiers, etc.), but in this case, since it's a direct property, 'wdt' should suffice.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused, but I think the main idea is to replace res:Cameroon with wd:Q1009 and dbo:capital with wdt:P36. So the structure remains the same, just the entities and properties are from Wikidata.\n\nSo final answer is the SPARQL query with those replacements.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mappings. Cameroon is mapped to `wd:Q1009` and the capital relation to `wdt:P36`. The query selects distinct values for the capital of Cameroon.\n\n```sparql\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE {\n  wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The original query is counting the number of distinct programming languages in DBpedia. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the DBpedia query. It's selecting a count of distinct URIs where each URI is of type ProgrammingLanguage. The key part here is the rdf:type predicate, which in this case is <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ProgrammingLanguage>.\n\nNow, looking at the mappings provided in 'er2', the DBpedia ID for ProgrammingLanguage is mapped to Wikidata's Q9143. This means that in Wikidata, the equivalent to DBpedia's ProgrammingLanguage is the item Q9143.\n\nNext, I need to understand how Wikidata structures its data. Instead of using rdf:type, Wikidata uses the predicate wdt:P31 for \"instance of\". So, to find all programming languages in Wikidata, I should use this predicate with the value wd:Q9143.\n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query should select all distinct items where the item is an instance of Q9143. Then, count these items to get the total number of programming languages.\n\nWait, I should make sure about the syntax. In Wikidata, the query would use PREFIXES like wdt and wd, so I'll include those. Also, ensuring that the count is done using COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) to avoid duplicates.\n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n1. Use the wdt:P31 predicate to state that the item is an instance of Q9143.\n2. Count the number of such distinct items.\n3. Ensure that the variable used is ?item and that it's properly named in the SELECT clause.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I can construct the final query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo count the number of programming languages in Wikidata, we use the predicate `wdt:P31` with `wd:Q9143` (Programming Language).

Define the prefixes `wdt` and `wd` for Wikidata properties and entities.\n2. Count distinct items where `?item` is an instance of \"Programming Language\" (Q9143).\n\nThe final query effectively translates the DBpedia query to Wikidata's structure.\n\nComment: This query accurately mirrors the DBpedia query using Wikidata's equivalent entities and syntax."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to come up with a SPARQL query for Wikidata that's equivalent to the given DBpedia query. Let me start by understanding the original query. It's selecting all distinct URIs where the subject is an Astronaut, either from Russia or the Soviet Union. \n\nBreaking it down, the key parts are:\n1. The class is Astronaut, which in DBpedia is \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Astronaut\".\n2. The property for nationality is \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/nationality\".\n3. The nationalities being checked are for Russia (\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia\") and the Soviet Union (\"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union\").\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mappings provided, I can map these DBpedia resources to their Wikidata counterparts. \n\n- The Astronaut class in DBpedia maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11631\".\n- Nationality in DBpedia maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P27\".\n- Russia in DBpedia maps to both \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2184\" and \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q159\", but Q2184 is the main one.\n- Soviet Union in DBpedia maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15180\".\n\nSo, substituting these into the query structure, I'll need to select entities where the occupation (P106) is Astronaut (Q11631), and the country of citizenship (P27) is either Russia (Q2184) or Soviet Union (Q15180). \n\nWait, in Wikidata, the property for nationality is P27, which is \"country of citizenship\". So I'll use that. Also, the occupation is under P106, which corresponds to the class we're interested in.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query using UNION to include both nationalities. I'll make sure it's DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. Also, using dbr: for the country entities because sometimes Wikidata prefixes are helpful, but I'll check if it works with just the Q codes.\n\nI think that's it. So the final query should select all ?item where ?item is an instance of Astronaut, with the nationality being either Russia or Soviet Union.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided DBpedia query and mappings:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - Astronaut (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Astronaut` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q11631`)\n   - Nationality (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/nationality` \u2192 Wikidata: `P27`)\n   - Russia (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q2184`, `Q159`)\n   - Soviet Union (DBpedia: `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union` \u2192 Wikidata: `Q15180`)\n\n2. **Construct Query**:\n   - Use `ocupation` property `P106` to denote Astronaut.\n   - Use `country of citizenship` property `P27`.\n   - Incorporate UNION for Russia and Soviet Union nationalities.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item p:P106 ps:P106 Q11631.\n  {\n    ?item p:P27 ps:P27 dbr:Q2184\n  } UNION {\n    ?item p:P27 ps:P27 dbr:Q15180\n  }\n}\n```"

The query was selecting the URI of the creator. So, I need to map those terms to Wikidata equivalents.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, Family Guy in DBpedia is mapped to Q5930 in Wikidata. The 'creator' relation in DBpedia is P170 in Wikidata. So, I should use these in the Wikidata query.\n\nIn Wikidata, properties are usually prefixed with 'wdt:' and entities with 'wd:'.

I'll make sure to use DISTINCT to get unique results.\n\nI think that's all.

The equivalent in Wikidata is `wd:Q5930`.\n\n2. **Creator**: In DBpedia, this is `dbo:creator`.

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the user wants to know the population of Mexico City using SPARQL on Wikidata, but they've provided the query for DBpedia. My task is to convert that DBpedia query into a Wikidata one. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the original DBpedia query. It's using dbo:populationTotal to get the population of Mexico City. The prefix dbo refers to DBpedia's ontology, and dbr is the resource namespace. So, in DBpedia, they're querying where Mexico City has a populationTotal.\n\nNow, the user provided some mappings in ER2. The first mapping is from dbpedia_id \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mexico_City\" to wikidata_id \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489\". That means Mexico City in DBpedia is Q1489 in Wikidata. \n\nNext, the second mapping is from dbpedia_id \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/populationTotal\" to wikidata_id \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1082\". So, populationTotal in DBpedia corresponds to P1082 in Wikidata, which I think stands for 'population'.\n\nPutting this together, the original query is asking for the populationTotal of Mexico City. In Wikidata, that translates to asking for the value of property P1082 for the entity Q1489. \n\nWikidata uses the prefix wd for entities and p for properties, but in SPARQL, we can use the full IRIs or define prefixes. For simplicity, I'll use the full IRIs. Alternatively, defining a prefix like 'wd' would make the query cleaner.\n\nSo, the triple pattern in SPARQL would be <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1082> ?population. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that in Wikidata, properties are often used with a 'direct' path. So, using 'prop/direct' ensures we're getting the direct value. Also, sometimes there might be qualifiers or references, but since the original query doesn't specify, I can ignore that for now.\n\nNow, constructing the SPARQL query: I'll start with the SELECT clause to get the population. Then, the WHERE clause will have the triple I just mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?population where Q1489 has P1082 as ?population. \n\nI should also check if there's any specific syntax in Wikidata that I might be missing, like using 'wd:' prefixes, but since the mapping gives me the full IRIs, using them directly is safe. Alternatively, defining a prefix for wikidata like 'wd' and then using wd:Q1489 would make the query more readable.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, the common practice is to use 'wd:' as the prefix for entities and 'wds:' for some datasets, but the standard is to use full URIs or the 'wd' prefix. Let me verify that. Yes, typically, you can define PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and then use wd:Q1489.\n\nSo, if I include the PREFIX, the query becomes cleaner. Let me adjust that. So, I'll add PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and then use wd:Q1489 and wd:P1082. No, wait, P1082 is a property, so it's in the prop namespace, so wd:P1082 isn't correct. The correct way is to use the 'p' prefix for properties. So maybe I should define both 'wd' for entities and 'p' for properties.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the full URI for the property, which would be <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1082>. Hmm, that might be more accurate to ensure there's no confusion. But using prefixes is cleaner.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, properties have their own namespace, so to use a property in a SPARQL query, you typically define the 'p' prefix like PREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/> and then use p:P1082. But in practice, most queries use direct properties with 'wd' as the entity prefix and 'p' for properties, but sometimes 'ps' for statements and 'pq' for qualifiers. However, for this simple query, I think using the direct property is sufficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the better way is to define two prefixes: one for entities and one for properties. Let me try that.\n\nWait, to keep it simple, maybe just write out the URIs without prefixes. So, the query would be:\n\nSELECT ?population WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1082> ?population }\n\nBut including prefixes makes it cleaner. So, adding PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and then using wd:Q1489. For the property, using the 'p' prefix: PREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P> so that p:1082 would be the property.\n\nWait no, the property URL is <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1082>, so the 'p' prefix is declared as <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P>, and then p:1082 would be the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, I can just construct the query with full URIs.\n\nBut best practice seems to be to define the prefixes for clarity. So, I'll add both wd and p prefixes.\n\nSo, the final query would have:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P>\nSELECT ?population WHERE { wd:Q1489 p:1082 ?population }\n\nAlternatively, using the full URIs:\n\nSELECT ?population WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1082> ?population }\n\nEither way works, but using prefixes is more readable.\n\nSo, that's the step-by-step approach: find the entity and property mappings, see how they translate from DBpedia to Wikidata, then construct the corresponding SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax and prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n1. **Identify the entities and relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Mexico City\n   - **Relation:** populationTotal\n\n2. **Map from DBpedia to Wikidata using ER2 mappings:**\n   - **Mexico City (DBpedia):** Q1489 (Wikidata)\n   - **populationTotal (DBpedia):** P1082 (Wikidata)\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata entity Q1489 and property P1082.\n   - The standard SPARQL syntax for Wikidata includes defining prefixes for entities and properties.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P>\n\nSELECT ?population \nWHERE { \n  wd:Q1489 p:1082 ?population \n}\n</sparql>\n```"

I know that in DBpedia, the query uses the 'creator' property, but I need to map this to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I'll check the entity mappings provided. Batman in DBpedia is linked to Q2695156 in Wikidata. The 'creator' property in DBpedia is mapped to P170 in Wikidata, which is the 'creator' property there as well.\n\nSo, the structure would be similar to the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's syntax. Instead of 'dbo:creator', I should use 'wdt:P170'. Also, I need to select the variable for the creator, maybe using a different name like ?creatorUri to avoid confusion.\n\nI remember that in Wikidata, you can use '\ubcf5\uc9c0' for the prefix, but sometimes it's better to just use the full URL. Wait, no, 'wdt' is for stated in, but here I just need to use 'wd' perhaps? Or maybe 'p' and 'ps' for statements and qualifiers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the mapping directly points to P170, I can use 'wdt:P170' directly in the query.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll select ?creatorUri where Q2695156 has the P170 property. That should give me the creator of Batman in Wikidata.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes. Typically, 'wd' is for entities and 'wdt' for properties, so I include those in the PREFIX section.\n\nAlright, I think I've got the structure right. Now, let me write that out as a proper SPARQL query.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Batman** is mapped to Q2695156 in Wikidata.\n   - **Creator** in DBpedia is mapped to P170 in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Understand the Query Pattern**:\n   - The query pattern retrieves the creator of Batman.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata Syntax**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity Q2695156 for Batman.\n   - Use the property wdt:P170 for 'creator'.\n\n4. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Select the creator URI where Q2695156 has the P170 property.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?creatorUri \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q2695156 wdt:P170 ?creatorUri.\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the creator of Batman through Wikidata's P170 property."

The user has provided a similar query for DBpedia and the entity-relation mappings, so I'll need to convert that to Wikidata syntax.\n\nFirst, let me go through the problem step by step. The original query in DBpedia is selecting the population number where Australia's capital has that population. The key entities and relations here are:\n\n- Australia (resource)\n- capital (relation)\n- populationTotal (relation)\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings:\n\n- Australia in DBpedia maps to three Wikidata entities: Q25907685, Q408, and Q3960. I think Q408 is the correct one because it's the main entity for Australia.\n- The 'capital' relation in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P36.\n- 'populationTotal' maps to Wikidata's P1082.\n\nNow, I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata. In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with 'wd:', and properties with 'wdt:'. So the structure would be:\n\nSELECT ?num WHERE {\n  wd:Q408 wdt:P36 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P1082 ?num .\n}\n\nI should make sure that the query follows the same pattern: Australia -> capital -> population. I'll double-check if P36 represents the capital relation correctly and if P1082 is indeed population. \n\nYes, P36 is for capital, and P1082 is for population, so the query should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo find the population of Australia's capital using Wikidata, we'll query the capital city of Australia and its population count.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** Australia (Q408 in Wikidata)\n   - **Relation:** Capital (P36)\n   - **Property for Population:** Population (P1082)\n\n2. **Construct SPARQL Query:**\n   - Select the population value.\n   - Australia (wd:Q408) has a capital (wdt:P36) which is a city.\n   - That city has a population (wdt:P1082).\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?num WHERE {\n  wd:Q408 wdt:P36 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P1082 ?num .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the population of Australia's capital city from Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the total area of North Rhine-Westphalia. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original DBpedia query. It uses the dbo:areaTotal property to get the area. The query is straightforward, selecting ?tarea where North_Rhine-Westphalia has the areaTotal property.\n\nNow, I need to map this to Wikidata. The ER2 mappings provided show that dbr:North_Rhine-Westphalia corresponds to wd:Q1198, and dbo:areaTotal corresponds to wdt:P2046. So, I'll replace DBpedia's resources and properties with these Wikidata equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax uses wd: for entities and wdt: for properties. The property wdt:P2046 is the area, and I need to make sure it's the total area, not some other type. Wikidata might have different literals or units, but I think P2046 refers to the total area.\n\nSo, the structure of the query will be similar. I'll select ?area where the entity Q1198 has the property P2046 with the value ?area. I'll write this using the Wikidata prefixes and ensure the syntax is correct.\n\nI should validate if wdt:P2046 is indeed the correct property for total area. Sometimes, properties can have different scopes or might require additional qualifiers, but in this case, P2046 seems to be the standard for area.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll replace the DBpedia prefixes and resources with the Wikidata ones, keeping the same query pattern but adjusted for Wikidata's syntax. That should give me the correct SPARQL query to retrieve the total area of North Rhine-Westphalia from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the total area of North Rhine-Westphalia, we'll use the mappings provided. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n1. **Identify the key entities and relations**:\n   - **Entity**: North Rhine-Westphalia\n   - **Relation**: areaTotal\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata**:\n   - **North_Rhine-Westphalia** maps to **Q1198**\n   - **dbo:areaTotal** maps to **P2046**\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**:\n   - Use Wikidata prefixes: `wd` for entities and `wdt` for properties.\n   - Query structure: Select `?area` where `wd:Q1198` has property `wdt:P2046` with value `?area`.\n\n4. **Validate the query**: Ensure all entities and properties align with Wikidata's data model.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?area \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?area\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the original question is asking about the number of employees IBM has. The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia, so I need to convert that to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, the DBpedia resource for IBM is mapped to two Wikidata entities: Q70096636 and Q37156. The number of employees in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P1128 property.\n\nNow, I recall that in Wikidata, IRIs are usually prefixed with 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. But in the final query, I think the prefixes are used as 'wd:' and 'p:'.\n\nSo, translating the DBpedia query to Wikidata, I'll need to replace the DBpedia IRIs with the Wikidata ones. The subject will be one of the IBM entities, and the predicate is P1128.\n\nI should check both Wikidata entities to see which one is appropriate. Typically, Q37156 is the main entity for IBM, so I'll use that.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select the number where IBM (Q37156) has the property P1128 (number of employees).\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct syntax, including prefixes. So, the final query will use 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for the property.\n\nI think that's it. Now, I'll write the query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given mappings and the structure of the DBpedia query:\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: IBM (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/IBM`) maps to Wikidata entities `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q70096636` and `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37156`.\n   - **Relation**: `numberOfEmployees` (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/numberOfEmployees`) maps to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1128` (number of employees).\n\n2. **Query Pattern**:\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves the number of employees for IBM by querying the `numberOfEmployees` property.\n\n3. **Equivalent Properties in Wikidata**:\n   - The `numberOfEmployees` property in DBpedia maps to the `P1128` property in Wikidata.\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity ID for IBM (`Q37156`) and the `P1128` property for the number of employees.\n   - Maintain the same query structure, selecting the number of employees.\n\n5. **Validate the Query**:\n   - Ensure the query aligns with Wikidata's syntax and data model.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?number WHERE {\n    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37156> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1128> ?number\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the budget of \"Pulp Fiction.\" I know that the user has already provided a query for DBpedia, and now they want the equivalent for Wikidata. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the DBpedia query. It uses the prefix dbo for the ontology and res for the resource. The query is selecting the budget of Pulp Fiction. So, the structure is res:Pulp_Fiction dbo:budget ?n.\n\nNow, using the ER2 mappings provided, I can see that the DBpedia resource for Pulp Fiction maps to Wikidata's Q104123. The budget property in DBpedia, which is dbo:budget, corresponds to Wikidata's P2769, which I believe represents the budget as well.\n\nIn Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using prefixes like 'dbo' or 'res', I need to use the full URIs or the prefixes defined in Wikidata. Typically, 'wd' is used for entities and 'p' or 'ps' for properties. The budget property is P2769, and to get the value, I should use ps:P2769. \n\nSo, putting this together, the query should select the budget where the item is Q104123 and the property is P2769 with some value. The structure would be something like selecting ?budget where the item wdt:P2769 is ?budget.\n\nWait, but sometimes Wikidata uses 'ps' for statements and 'p' for qualifiers. Since we just want the budget value, I can use 'wdt' which is the shortcut for rdf:type and property assertions. So, using wdt:P2769 should suffice.\n\nLet me double-check. The equivalent of dbo:budget in Wikidata is wdt:P2769. So the query should be:\n\nSELECT ?n WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q104123> wdt:P2769 ?n }\n\nBut in Wikidata, the common practice is to use the 'wd' prefix for entities and 'p' or 'ps' for properties. However, since the user's instruction allows for using the latest syntax, I think it's better to write it with the full URI to avoid any confusion, but in practice, using prefixes is more readable.\n\nAlternatively, defining the prefixes like 'wd' and 'wpt' for properties might be clearer. So, the query might look like:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?n WHERE { wd:Q104123 wdt:P2769 ?n }\n\nThis way, it's more readable and uses the correct prefixes.\n\nI should also make sure that this query retrieves the budget correctly. Sometimes, in Wikidata, the budget is stored as a quantity, so ?n might be of type wikibase:Quantity. But the query should still work without needing to specify the type since we just want the value.\n\nI think that's about it. The key was mapping the DBpedia resource and property to their Wikidata counterparts using the ER2 mapping and then restructuring the SPARQL query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo retrieve the budget of \"Pulp Fiction\" from Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata equivalents and structure the query accordingly.\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?n \nWHERE { \n    wd:Q104123 wdt:P2769 ?n \n}\n```\n\nThis query fetches the budget of \"Pulp Fiction\" using the correct Wikidata identifiers and syntax."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user generate a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided information. They've given me a natural language question, the corresponding SPARQL query for DBpedia, and an entity and relation mapping (ER2). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question is: \"What movies does Jesse Eisenberg play in?\" So, the goal is to find all the movies where Jesse Eisenberg is an actor. The SPARQL query for DBpedia is SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesse_Eisenberg> }. This means we're looking for all resources that are films and have Jesse Eisenberg as a starring actor.\n\nNow, using the ER2 mappings, I can map the DBpedia entities and relations to Wikidata. \n\n1. The first mapping is for \"Film\". The DBpedia ID is http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film, which maps to Wikidata's Q11424. So, in Wikidata, films are represented by this ID.\n   \n2. The second mapping is for \"starring\". The DBpedia property is http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring, which maps to Wikidata's P161. So, in Wikidata, the property to indicate an actor in a film is P161.\n\n3. The third mapping is for \"Jesse_Eisenberg\". The DBpedia resource is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesse_Eisenberg, which maps to Wikidata's Q219512. So, Jesse Eisenberg is represented by this ID in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. The structure should be similar to the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's syntax and properties. \n\nIn DBpedia, the query finds all ?uri where ?uri is a Film and stars Jesse Eisenberg. In Wikidata, this translates to finding all ?uri where ?uri is an instance of Q11424 (Film) and has the P161 property with Q219512 (Jesse Eisenberg).\n\nSo, the SPARQL query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n       p:P161 [ps:P161 wd:Q219512]\n}\n\nLet me verify that. \"wdt:P31\" is used for \"instance of\" in Wikidata, so ?uri is a film. The property \"p:P161\" with \"ps:P161\" is for the starring relationship, connecting the film to Jesse Eisenberg. Using \"SELECT DISTINCT\" ensures we get unique results.\n\nI think that's correct. Just to make sure, I can consider if there are alternative ways to structure this query, but this seems to align well with Wikidata's data model. So, the final query should work as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that identifies the films starring Jesse Eisenberg, we map the DBpedia entities and relationships to their Wikidata equivalents and adapt the query structure accordingly. The final query is as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n       p:P161 [ps:P161 wd:Q219512]\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all unique films (Q11424) where Jesse Eisenberg (Q219512) is listed under the starring role (P161)."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to convert a SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. The original query is asking for all Danish movies. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the given DBpedia query. It selects distinct URIs where the URI is of type Film and the country is Denmark. So, the key components are the type (Film) and the country (Denmark). \n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings provided, the DBpedia type \"Film\" maps to Wikidata's Q11424, which is also \"film.\" The property \"country\" in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P17. Lastly, Denmark in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities: Q5257925 and Q35. I think Q35 is the main one since it's the top-level entity for Denmark.\n\nNow, I need to construct the Wikidata query. In Wikidata, to find entities, we use the 'wd' prefix for entities and 'p' and 'ps' for properties. So, to check if something is a film, we use 'wd:Q11424'. For the country, we use 'p:P17' and 'ps:P17' to specify the value, which is 'wd:Q35' for Denmark.\n\nPutting it all together, I want to select all items where the item is a film and has country Denmark. So the query becomes selecting ?item where ?item has type film and country set to Denmark.\n\nI should also make sure the syntax is correct, using 'WHERE' and 'FILTER' as needed. Wait, in Wikidata, sometimes it's better to structure it with a filter. Alternatively, using the property paths correctly.\n\nI think the final query should look something like selecting ?item and ?itemLabel for the names, with the filter checking the type and the country. So, the SPARQL query should include the prefixes, the select statement, and the where clause with the necessary triple patterns and filters.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the DBpedia SPARQL query to Wikidata, we'll map the entities and relations using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations:**\n   - **Entity:** `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film`\n   - **Relation:** `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country`\n   - **Value:** `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark`\n\n2. **Map to Wikidata:**\n   - `Film` maps to `wd:Q11424`\n   - `country` maps to `p:P17`\n   - `Denmark` maps to `wd:Q35`\n\n3. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Use `?item` to represent the entities.\n   - Use `p:P17` and `ps:P17` to specify the property and its value.\n   - Filter by type using `bias:sttype(?item) = wd:Q11424` to ensure items are films.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX bias: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Entity:>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?itemLabel\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item p:P17/ps:P17 wd:Q35 .\n  FILTER(bias:sttype(?item) = wd:Q11424)\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"en\" }\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

The query uses the DBpedia ontology, so I need to map these elements to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\nFrom ER2, the DBpedia resource <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas> maps to three Wikidata entities: Q105981852, Q26235529, and Q5451.

I need to make sure the syntax is correct, using 'WHERE' to specify the triple, and ensure that the variable names match.\n\nI should also check if there are any specific prefixes or namespaces needed, but in this case, using the standard wd and p should suffice.\n\nFinally, I'll enclose the query within the <sparql> tags as the user requested.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify key entities and relations**:  \n   - **Entity**: Angela Merkel  \n   - **Relation**: almaMater  \n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata using ER2 mappings**:  \n   - dbr:Angela_Merkel \u2192 wd:Q567  \n   - dbo:almaMater \u2192 wd:P69  \n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata syntax**:  \n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?Almamater WHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?Almamater\n}\n```\n\nThe query retrieves the alma mater of Angela Merkel using the Wikidata property `P69` (educational institution).  \n\n**Final SPARQL query for Wikidata**:  \n```sparql\nSELECT ?Almamater WHERE { wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?Almamater }\n```  \n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?Almamater WHERE { wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?Almamater }\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the provided context. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key entities and relations in the question. The user is asking who created Goofy. So, the main entities here are \"Goofy\" and \"creator.\"\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see that \"Goofy\" in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q111135. The \"creator\" relation in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P170. \n\nNext, I analyze the original SPARQL query on DBpedia. It's selecting the URI where Goofy is the subject and creator is the predicate. The structure is straightforward: SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { Goofy creator ?uri }.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into Wikidata's syntax. In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with \"wd:\", and properties with \"wdt:\". So, Goofy becomes wd:Q111135 and creator becomes wdt:P170.\n\nPutting it all together, the Wikidata query should select distinct URIs where wd:Q111135 is related via wdt:P170. So, the query becomes SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q111135 wdt:P170 ?uri }.\n\nI should validate this to ensure it fits Wikidata's model. Wikidata uses RDF, so using wd: and wdt: is correct. The structure matches how properties are queried there.\n\nThus, the final SPARQL query should accurately retrieve the creator of Goofy from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and relationships from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n1. **Identify Key Entities and Relations**:\n   - **Entity**: Goofy (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goofy` is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q111135` in Wikidata).\n   - **Relation**: Creator (`http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator` is mapped to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P170` in Wikidata).\n\n2. **Analyze the Query Pattern**:\n   - The original SPARQL query retrieves the URI of the creator of Goofy from DBpedia.\n\n3. **Map to Wikidata Syntax**:\n   - In Wikidata, entities are referenced with `wd:` and properties with `wdt:`.\n\n4. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Use the mapped Wikidata entity and property to form the query.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query for Wikidata:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n    wd:Q111135 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>\n```"
