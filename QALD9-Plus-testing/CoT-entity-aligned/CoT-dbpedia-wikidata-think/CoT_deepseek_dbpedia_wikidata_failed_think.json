    "sparql_query_raw": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the SPARQL query for Wikidata to determine the budget of \"The Lego Movie.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original DBpedia query, it selects the budget of \"The Lego Movie.\" The query uses 'dbo:budget' from DBpedia. I have the ER2 mappings which tell me that 'dbo:budget' in DBpedia corresponds to 'P2769' in Wikidata. Similarly, the entity 'The_Lego_Movie' in DBpedia maps to 'Q2608065' in Wikidata.\n\nNow, I need to construct a similar query in Wikidata. I know that in Wikidata, we use 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for properties, followed by 'ps:' or 'pq:' for qualifiers. So, the movie is 'wd:Q2608065' and the budget property is 'p:P2769'.\n\nPutting it together, the query should select the budget where the movie has that property. I can write it as SELECT ?n WHERE { wd:Q2608065 p:P2769 ?n. }. This should retrieve the budget value associated with \"The Lego Movie\" in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo form the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and relations to their Wikidata equivalents using the ER2 mappings provided. The movie entity maps to `wd:Q2608065` and the budget property maps to `p:P2769`. The query selects the budget value associated with the movie.\n\nsparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?n\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q2608065 wdt:P2769 ?n\n}\n</sparql>"

    "natural_language_question": "How tall is Claudia Schiffer?",
    "sparql_query_raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. The original question is asking for Claudia Schiffer's height, and the DBpedia query uses PREFIX dbo and res with a SELECT statement to get ?height where Claudia Schiffer has the dbo:height property.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the DBpedia query. It's selecting the height of Claudia Schiffer. So, the main entity is Claudia Schiffer, and the property is height.\n\nLooking at the provided ER2 mappings, Claudia Schiffer in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q76717. The height property in DBpedia (dbo:height) is mapped to Wikidata's P2048. So, I need to replace the DBpedia resources and properties with their Wikidata equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are usually prefixed with wd, and properties with p. However, the actual property for height is P2048, but in SPARQL, sometimes you can use the direct property or the statement. So, I should use wdt:P2048 for the height value.\n\nI should also update the PREFIX from dbo and res to the appropriate Wikidata ones. Wikidata typically uses the prefix wdid for entities and wdt for properties. So, I'll define PREFIX wdid as <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and PREFIX wdt as <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?height where wdid:Q76717 has wdt:P2048 as ?height. I should keep DISTINCT to avoid duplicates.\n\nI should double-check if P2048 is indeed the correct property for height in Wikidata. Yes, P2048 corresponds to 'height' in Wikidata, so that's correct.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the query structure aligns with Wikidata's model. In Wikidata, the property is straightforward, so using wdt:P2048 should be sufficient without needing any additional qualifiers or statements.\n\nSo, the final query should look like selecting ?height where the Claudia Schiffer entity (Q76717) has the height property (P2048) set to ?height.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts. \n\n/sparql\nPREFIX wdid: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?height \nWHERE {\n    wdid:Q76717 wdt:P2048 ?height\n}\n/sparql\n\nThis query retrieves Claudia Schiffer's height from Wikidata."
