        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to find out who the founder of Penguin Books is using the Wikidata knowledge graph. I'm more familiar with DBpedia, but I guess the process is somewhat similar. Let me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided, I see that the user first queried DBpedia using SPARQL. The query used the DBpedia ontology (dbo:) and resources (res:) to ask for the founder of Penguin Books. Now, the task is to do the same but using Wikidata, which I think is another large knowledge graph but structured differently.\n\nIn the ER2 mapping, I see that Penguin Books in DBpedia corresponds to two Wikidata entities: Q1336200 and Q3374730. I suppose these might be different entries or versions in Wikidata for Penguin Books. Then, the founder relation in DBpedia (dbo:founder) maps to Wikidata's P112, which I think stands for \"founder\" as well.\n\nSo, I need to translate the original SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. In DBpedia, they use res: for resources and dbo: for ontologies. In Wikidata, everything is based on entities and properties, using prefixes like wd: and wdt:.\n\nI remember that in Wikidata, to construct a query, you typically use wd: for the entity URIs and wdt: for the property URIs. So, for the subject, instead of res:Penguin_Books, I should use the Wikidata entity, probably wd:Q1336200. For the predicate, instead of dbo:founder, it's wdt:P112.\n\nThe object in the triple would be the variable, which in this case, let's keep it as ?uri since that's what the user used before. So putting it together, the triple pattern becomes wd:Q1336200 wdt:P112 ?uri.\n\nI also know that in Wikidata SPARQL, you don't need a separate PREFIX for resources and ontologies; instead, you use wd: and wdt: directly. So I should adjust the prefixes accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct ?uri where Penguin Books (in Wikidata) has the P112 (founder) property with the value ?uri.\n\nWait, but there are two Wikidata IDs for Penguin Books: Q1336200 and Q3374730. Should I include both? Maybe I should, to get all possible results. But the original query only used one resource, so perhaps it's better to use both with a UNION or just include both entities in the query.\n\nHowever, in the ER2, both Q1336200 and Q3374730 map to the same DBpedia resource. So to cover all possibilities, I should include both entities in the query. I can do this using a UNION or by using a VALUES clause, which might be more efficient.\n\nHmm, using VALUES might be cleaner than UNION. So I can write something like:\n\nVALUES ?entity { wd:Q1336200 wd:Q3374730 }\n\nThen, in the WHERE clause, ?entity wdt:P112 ?uri.\n\nSo the full query would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?entity { wd:Q1336200 wd:Q3374730 }\n  ?entity wdt:P112 ?uri\n}\n\nBut wait, the user didn't use any other prefixes beyond dbo: and res:. Maybe in Wikidata, the common practice is to just use wd: and wdt: without explicit prefixes, but I think for clarity, it's better to include them.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people omit the prefixes if they're standard, but I think it's safer to include them to avoid any errors.\n\nSo, including the prefixes and the query as above should correctly fetch the founder of Penguin Books from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find the founder of Penguin Books, we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Relation in Wikidata:**\n   - **Entity (Penguin Books):**Mapped to two Wikidata entities: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1336200` and `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3374730`.\n   - **Relation (founder):**Mapped to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P112`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declarations for Wikidata entities (`wd:`) and direct properties (`wdt:`).\n   - Use the `VALUES` clause to include both Wikidata entities for Penguin Books.\n   - Query for the founder using the property `wdt:P112`.\n\n3. **Final Query:**\n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?uri \n   WHERE {\n     VALUES ?entity { wd:Q1336200 wd:Q3374730 }\n     ?entity wdt:P112 ?uri\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis query retrieves the founder of Penguin Books from Wikidata.\n\n</sparql>\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  VALUES ?entity { wd:Q1336200 wd:Q3374730 }\n  ?entity wdt:P112 ?uri\n}\n```"

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which films Stanley Kubrick directed, but this time using Wikidata instead of DBpedia. I remember from the previous example that SPARQL queries are used to fetch data from knowledge graphs like DBpedia or Wikidata. \n\nFirst, I should start by recalling what I know about Wikidata. It's similar to DBpedia but structures data differently. Both use RDF triples, but the way entities and properties are named might be different. In the context provided earlier, there was some mapping between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and properties. Specifically, the ER2 mapping showed that DBpedia's director property corresponds to Wikidata's P57, and Stanley Kubrick's DBpedia resource is mapped to Wikidata's Q2001.\n\nSo, in DBpedia, the query was straightforward: find all URIs where the director is Stanley Kubrick. The SPARQL query used 'dbo:director' and 'res:Stanley_Kubrick'. Now, I need to translate that into Wikidata terms.\n\nI think in Wikidata, entities are usually prefixed with 'wd:' and properties with 'p:' or 'pq:', but I'm not entirely sure. From the ER2, 'dbo:director' maps to 'P57' in Wikidata, which is a property. So, in Wikidata SPARQL syntax, I would use 'wdt:P57' for the director property.\n\nSimilarly, 'res:Stanley_Kubrick' maps to 'Q2001' in Wikidata, so I should reference it as 'wd:Q2001'.\n\nNext, I need to structure the SPARQL query. The goal is to find all entities (films) where Stanley Kubrick is the director. So, the triples would be [?film wdt:P57 wd:Q2001]. But wait, in SPARQL, the order is subject-predicate-object, so 'wd:Q2001' is the object, meaning the director of ?film is Kubrick.\n\nI think the query should select ?film, so maybe using SELECT DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. So something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film\nWHERE {\n  ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q2001 .\n}\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about whether 'wdt' is the correct prefix for Wikidata. I think in some setups, properties are prefixed with 'wdt:' for claims and 'wdpq:' for qualifiers, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the correct way might be using 'p:' and 'ps:' prefixes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen examples where 'wdt' is used directly without a prefix, but I think you need to define the prefix first. So, I should start the query with PREFIX definitions.\n\nSo, the prefixes would be something like:\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nThen, the query would use 'wdt:P57' to represent the director property.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should start with the prefixes, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause that defines the triple.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct URIs for Kubrick and the director property. So, replacing 'dbo:director' with 'wdt:P57' and 'res:Stanley_Kubrick' with 'wd:Q2001'.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether 'wd:Q2001' is correctly referenced. I think 'wd:Q2001' is the correct way in Wikidata to refer to Stanley Kubrick.\n\nSo, after structuring all that, the final SPARQL query should look similar to the DBpedia one, but adjusted for Wikidata's syntax and prefixes.\n\nI might be missing some parts or mixing up the prefixes, so I should double-check if 'P57' is indeed the correct property for director in Wikidata. From the ER2 mapping, it seems correct.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the query is fetching films directed by Kubrick, so the subject is the film, the predicate is the director property, and the object is Kubrick.\n\nI think that's about it. Now, I'll try to write the actual SPARQL query with these considerations.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mapping. The director property 'dbo:director' in DBpedia corresponds to 'P57' in Wikidata, and Stanley Kubrick is represented as 'Q2001' in Wikidata. The query is structured to select all distinct films (subjects) where the director (predicate) is Stanley Kubrick (object).\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film\nWHERE {\n  ?film wdt:P57 wd:Q2001 .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me start by understanding the original question and the given context.\n\nThe original question is asking to list all the musicals with music by Elton John. The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia (KG1) and some mappings between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and relations.\n\nFirst, let me look at the SPARQL query from KG1. It's using DBpedia's ontology and resources. The query is selecting ?uri where ?uri is of type dbo:Musical and has dbo:musicBy res:Elton_John.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mappings, I see the following:\n\n1. dbo:Musical (DBpedia) corresponds to wikidata:Q2743.\n2. dbo:musicBy (DBpedia) corresponds to wikidata:P86.\n3. res:Elton_John (DBpedia) corresponds to wikidata:Q2808.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the equivalent query would need to find entities that are instances of the \"musical\" (Q2743), and have the \"music by\" (P86) relation set to Elton John (Q2808).\n\nIn Wikidata, the structure for such a query would involve using the RDF type (rdf:type) and the property (wdt:P86) for \"music by\". The prefix wd is commonly used for Wikidata, where wdt stands for \"Wikidata truth\" for static statements, and p and ps for property and its qualifiers, but in this case, since we're looking for direct statements, wdt:P86 is appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query should select ?uri where ?uri has a type of wd:Q2743 and has the wdt:P86 relation to wd:Q2808.\n\nI need to make sure the prefixes are correctly set. In Wikidata, the common prefix is wd for entities. So the query would start with the appropriate prefixes, DECLARE them at the beginning.\n\nPutting it all together, the final query will select distinct ?uri where it's a musical, and the music is by Elton John in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nThe process involves mapping the original DBpedia query to Wikidata entities and properties using ER2. We identify the musical as Q2743, musicBy as P86, and Elton John as Q2808. Using the correct prefix (wd) and property syntax (wdt), the SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri rdf:type wd:Q2743 ;\n       wdt:P86 wd:Q2808\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

From the provided context, I see that in DBpedia, the query uses `dbo:developer` to link Skype to its developer. I need to find the equivalent property in Wikidata. The ER2 mapping shows that `dbo:developer` corresponds to `wikidata:P178`, which stands for \"developer\" in Wikidata.\n\nNext, I need to identify the entity for Skype in Wikidata. Looking at ER2, Skype's DBpedia ID maps to `wikidata:Q40984`. This means I should use `wd:Q40984` to represent Skype in the query.\n\nNow, I'll structure the SPARQL query. I'll use the `PREFIX` declarations for clarity, defining `wd` for Wikidata and `wdt` for its data properties. The `SELECT` statement will retrieve the developer's URI. The `WHERE` clause will specify that Skype (`wd:Q40984`) has a `wdt:P178` property, which links to the developer's entity.\n\nI should also ensure that the query is well-formatted and uses the correct prefixes to avoid any errors. Including `DISTINCT` will help in getting unique results. Additionally, I'll alias the variable `?developer` for better readability.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should fetch all distinct developers of Skype from Wikidata using the appropriate prefixes and properties. I should test this query in a SPARQL endpoint to confirm it returns the expected results, such as \"Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m\" and \"Janus Friis,\" who are known as Skype's developers.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were identifying the correct Wikidata entity for Skype, mapping the developer relation from DBpedia to Wikidata, and constructing a well-structured SPARQL query using the appropriate prefixes and syntax.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Entity and Property:**\n   - The entity we are interested in is \"Skype.\"\n   - The property we are interested in is \"developer.\"\n\n2. **Map DBpedia Entities to Wikidata:**\n   - From the provided ER2 mapping, `dbo:developer` maps to `wikidata:P178`.\n   - The resource \"Skype\" in DBpedia (`res:Skype`) maps to `wikidata:Q40984`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `PREFIX` to define the namespaces for Wikidata (`wd:` and `wdt:`).\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique developer entities.\n   - Use `WHERE` to specify the triple pattern for Skype and its developer.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?developer\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q40984 wdt:P178 ?developer.\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the distinct entities that have developed Skype from Wikidata."

The DBpedia \"league\" property is mapped to Wikidata's P118, which is the \"league\" property in Wikidata. I'll use `p:P118` in my query.\n\n3. The DBpedia resource \"Bundesliga\" is mapped to Wikidata's Q82595. So, I'll use `wd:Q82595` to represent the Bundesliga in Wikidata.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the syntax is a bit different. I don't use a separate 'a' for rdf:type; instead, I use `wdt:P31` for \"instance of\". Wait, no, I think `wdt:P31` is for \"instance of\" and `wdt:P118` is for \"league\". So, to find entities that are soccer clubs, I need to say that their instance is Q476028.\n\nSo, putting it together, I need to select all items where the item is an instance of Q476028 (soccer club) and has the league property P118 set to Q82595 (Bundesliga).\n\nIn SPARQL, that translates to:\n\nSELECT ?item WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ; p:P118 wd:Q82595 }\n\nWait, no. I think I should use `wdt:` for direct property values and `p:` for qualifiers. But in this case, I just want the soccer clubs in the Bundesliga, so maybe I don't need to go into qualifiers. Also, since we're just checking for the presence of P118 with value Q82595, I can write it as:\n\n?item wdt:P118 wd:Q82595\n\nAnd also ensure that the item is of type soccer club, so `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028`\n\nPutting it together, the WHERE clause has both these statements.\n\nSo the complete query is:\n\nSELECT ?item WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ; wdt:P118 wd:Q82595 }\n\nWait, but in Wikidata, the 'league' is under the property P118, so that should be correct.\n\nBut I think I should also make sure to get labels for better readability, but the user didn't specify that. So, I'll just get the items.\n\nI think also, since we have sub-properties or other relations, but in this case, P118 is the property we need.\n\nSo, the final query should look like that.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to their corresponding Wikidata counterparts. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Soccer Club Type**: In DBpedia, `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/SoccerClub` is mapped to Wikidata's `Q476028`. In Wikidata, \"instance of\" is represented by property `P31`.\n\n2. **Identify the League Property and Value**: The property `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/league` in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's `P118`. The Bundesliga in DBpedia (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bundesliga`) is mapped to Wikidata's `Q82595`.\n\n3. **Construct the Query**: In Wikidata SPARQL, we use `wdt` prefix for property values and `wd` for entity identifiers. The query will select all items that are instances of a soccer club (`P31 wd:Q476028`) and have the league property `P118` set to Bundesliga (`wd:Q82595`).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query**:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 ;\n        wdt:P118 wd:Q82595\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user by creating a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the information provided. The original query was for DBpedia, and now they want the equivalent for Wikidata. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia which retrieves actors starring in movies directed by William Shatner. The query was:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE { ?x dbo:director res:William_Shatner ; dbo:starring ?uri }\n\nSo, the main components here are:\n1.Finding resources (movies) where the director is William Shatner.\n2. From those movies, get the actors who starred in them.\n\nNow, for Wikidata, the process should be similar, but using Wikidata's entities and properties. From the ER2 mapping provided, I have the following correspondences:\n\n- DBpedia's 'director' (dbo:director) maps to Wikidata's P57 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P57).\n- DBpedia's 'William_Shatner' resource maps to Wikidata's Q16297.\n- DBpedia's 'starring' (dbo:starring) maps to Wikidata's P161 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P161).\n\nIn Wikidata, to find the director of a movie, we use P57. And to find the starring actors, we use P161. So, the structure of the query will be similar: find movies directed by William Shatner and then get the actors from those movies.\n\nIn Wikidata, prefixes are often defined but sometimes not necessary if using the full URIs. However, for readability, we can define a prefix for Wikidata like 'wd'. So, I'll set PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nThe SPARQL query in DBpedia uses a variable ?x for the movie, which is fine, but in Wikidata, sometimes people use ?film or similar for clarity. However, it's not necessary, so I'll stick with ?x for consistency.\n\nSo, the WHERE clause should be:\n?x wdt:P57 wd:Q16297 ;\n   wdt:P161 ?actor .\n\nHere, wdt is the prefix for Wikidata's truthy statements, which is common in SPARQL queries against Wikidata. So, ?x is the movie, wdt:P57 denotes the director, which is William Shatner (wd:Q16297), and wdt:P161 gets the starring actors into ?actor.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct ?actor where the movie ?x has William Shatner as the director and ?actor as the star.\n\nI should also note that in Wikidata, sometimes there are multiple values for P161, so using DISTINCT ensures we don't get duplicate actor entries if they starred in multiple movies directed by Shatner.\n\nLet me double-check the syntax. Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint uses SERVICE <https://query.wikidata.org/sparql> but sometimes it's optional depending on the setup. However, for standard queries, just defining the prefixes and the WHERE clause should suffice.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll write out the complete SPARQL query as per these steps.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we translate the DBpedia query using the corresponding Wikidata entities and properties:\n\n1. **Define Prefixes**: Use `wd` for Wikidata entities.\n2. **Select Actors**: Query for ?actor.\n3. **Filter by Director**: Use P57 to find movies directed by William Shatner (Q16297).\n4. **Retrieve Stars**: Use P161 to get the starring actors.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?actor\nWHERE {\n    ?x wdt:P57 wd:Q16297 ;\n       wdt:P161 ?actor .\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that finds the highest mountain, similar to the DBpedia query provided. Let me think through this step by step, even though I'm not very experienced with SPARQL or Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the DBpedia query, they're selecting the URI of mountains with their elevation and ordering by elevation in descending order to get the highest one. They used the type Mountain and the elevation property.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that DBpedia's Mountain type corresponds to Wikidata's Q8502, so the mountain class in Wikidata is Q8502. Similarly, elevation in DBpedia is P2044 in Wikidata. So in Wikidata, the properties and classes have different identifiers.\n\nNow, I need to translate the DBpedia query into Wikidata's structure. In Wikidata, entities are typically represented with 'wd' prefixes, properties with 'p' or 'ps' or 'pq', and items use 'Q' followed by numbers, like Q8502 for mountain.\n\nWait, I think in SPARQL for Wikidata, you have to use the property paths, so instead of just using the property directly, you might need to use something like 'ps' and 'pq' for the main property and its qualifier. Or maybe I can just use the shortcut notation. For example, 'p:P2044' would be the property, and its value can be a literal, and then maybe qualify it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check: in Wikidata, each property like P2044 has a type, and when querying, you can just write 'wdt:P2044' to get the elevation. Because 'wdt' is a shortcut for 'http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/'. So 'wdt' is for direct properties, like 'wdt:P2044' gives the elevation value directly.\n\nSo, to select the mountain entities, I'll write 'wd:Q8502' as the type. The query would look for items of type mountain, which in Wikidata is 'wd:Q8502', and then check for the property P2044 for elevation. So the query structure would be something like:\n\nSELECT ?uri WHERE { ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ; wdt:P2044 ?elevation }\n\nWait, is P31 the correct property for 'instance of'? I think so, because P31 is 'instance of' in Wikidata.\n\nWait, in the ER2, they mapped 'dbpedia_id': 'http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mountain' to 'wikidata_ids': 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502'. So in DBpedia, it's using 'a' for type, which would correspond to 'rdf:type', which in Wikidata is 'wdt:P31', right? So in Wikidata, to say something is a mountain, you do ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502.\n\nSo the query would start with selecting the ?uri, and then for each ?uri, it's of type mountain and has an elevation. So the query so far is:\n\nSELECT ?uri WHERE { ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ; wdt:P2044 ?elevation }\n\nNext, we need to order by elevation descending and limit to one. So we add ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) and LIMIT 1. So putting it all together, it would be:\n\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n     wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n\nAlso, I should use a prefix for the namespace to make it cleaner, so I can include 'PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>'. Otherwise, I have to write the full URIs, which makes the query longer.\n\nSo including the PREFIX makes it easier. Therefore, the final query would have the prefix declaration and then the SELECT as above.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user's final query didn't include the PREFIX, but when I try to write it, maybe it's better to include it for clarity, but perhaps it's not necessary if the query is using the wdt prefix correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Wikidata, the 'wdt' prefix is already commonly used and understood, so including it in the query helps avoid writing out the full URIs each time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query would start with the PREFIX, then SELECT, then the where clause with ?uri being a mountain and having elevation, then order and limit.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts using the provided ER2 mapping. We use 'wdt:P31' for the type and 'wdt:P2044' for elevation, then select, order, and limit the results.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Wikidata entities and properties**:\n   - Mountain type: `wd:Q8502` (mapped from DBpedia's Mountain).\n   - Elevation property: `wdt:P2044` (mapped from DBpedia's elevation).\n\n2. **Construct the query**:\n   - Select `?uri` where it is a mountain and has an elevation.\n   - Use `wdt:P31` to denote the 'instance of' relationship.\n   - Order results by descending elevation and limit to one.\n\nFinal SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n     wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the highest mountain is:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;\n     wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

Now, since I'm moving to Wikidata, I need to map the entities and properties correctly from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that Olof Palme in DBpedia is linked to Wikidata's Q53713. So, in the SPARQL query, I'll use the Wikidata ID for Olof Palme, which is wd:Q53713.\n\nNext, the property used in DBpedia is deathDate, which maps to P570 in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, the death date is represented by the property wdt:P570.\n\nPutting this together, in Wikidata, to get Olof Palme's death date, I need to query for the subject wd:Q53713 and the predicate wdt:P570. The query will select the date, so I'll use SELECT DISTINCT to get a single value without duplicates.\n\nI should prefix the query with the Wikidata endpoint, which is usually <http://query.wikidata.org/sparql>, but in the SPARQL query, it's often included implicitly by the endpoint. However, for clarity, I'll include PREFIXes for wikidata and wdt to make it explicit. This helps in readability and ensures that the query runs correctly without ambiguity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the SPARQL query will start with the prefixes, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause specifying the subject, predicate, and object.\n\nI think that's it. I should make sure that the syntax is correct, using angle brackets for URIs and proper prefixes. Also, making sure that the variable ?date is used to capture the death date.\n</think>\n\nTo find the death date of Olof Palme in Wikidata, I map the DBpedia resources to their Wikidata counterparts.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that finds movies starring both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. I'm not very familiar with SPARQL or Wikidata, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in the previous example, the user used DBpedia. They selected movies where both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are starring. The SPARQL query for DBpedia used the \"starring\" property and the specific URIs for those actors. Now, they want to do the same for Wikidata, so I guess I need to translate those parts from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that the \"starring\" property in DBpedia corresponds to P161 in Wikidata. Similarly, Elizabeth Taylor is Q34851 and Richard Burton is Q151973 in Wikidata. So, I'll need to use these identifiers instead.\n\nIn Wikidata, entities are represented by Q numbers, and properties by P numbers followed by a modifier like 'ps'. I remember that in SPARQL, to access a property's value, you might use something like wdt:P161, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check if it's wdt or something else.\n\nSo, the structure of the query should be similar to the DBpedia one. I'll need to select distinct URIs where both actors are starring. The query should start with SELECT DISTINCT ?uri. Then, each starring statement will be a triple: the movie (uri) is connected via the starring property to each actor.\n\nPutting it together, I think it should look something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P161 wd:Q34851 ;\n      wdt:P161 wd:Q151973\n}\n\nI'm using wdt:P161 because that's the Wikidata way to refer to the property. Each starring is a separate triple connected with semicolons. I hope this will list all movies where both are starring.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, I translated the DBpedia properties and URIs using the provided ER2 mapping. The \"starring\" property in DBpedia is P161 in Wikidata, and the entities for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are Q34851 and Q151973, respectively. The query selects movies (URIs) that star both actors.\n\n``` <sparql> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P161 wd:Q34851 ;\n      wdt:P161 wd:Q151973\n}\n</sparql>"

The original query was selecting the record label of Elvis's first album. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER mapping provided. This will help me translate the DBpedia properties and entities into their corresponding Wikidata IDs. \n\nStarting with the album entity: DBpedia uses dbo:Album, which maps to Wikidata's Q482994. So in Wikidata, I'll use wd:Q482994.\n\nNext, the artist property. In DBpedia, it's dbo:artist, which corresponds to Wikidata's P175. So in SPARQL, this will be p:P175.\n\nThe artist in question is Elvis Presley. In DBpedia, it's res:Elvis_Presley, which maps to Wikidata's Q303. So I'll use wd:Q303 here.\n\nThe release date in DBpedia is dbo:releaseDate, which is P577 in Wikidata. So that's p:P577.\n\nLastly, the record label is dbo:recordLabel in DBpedia, which maps to P264 in Wikidata, so p:P264.\n\nNow, I need to structure the SPARQL query. I'll select the record label (p:P264), and make sure Elvis is the artist (p:P175 to wd:Q303). I'll order the results by release date (p:P577) to get the first album, and limit to just one result.\n\nI have to be careful with the syntax in Wikidata, using prefixes like p: for properties and wd: for entities. Also, I'll only select the label variable and order by the release date variable to ensure I get the earliest album.\n\nSo putting it all together, the query will select the record label, specify the type as Album, link to Elvis as the artist, order by release date, and return the first one.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation and the final SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the main components of the query:**\n   - **Select Clause:** `?label` (we need to fetch the record label name).\n   - **Triple Patterns:**\n     - The album entity.\n     - The artist relationship to Elvis Presley.\n     - The release date of the album.\n     - The record label relationship.\n   - **Sorting:** Order by release date to identify the first album.\n   - **Limitation:** Fetch only the first album.\n\n2. **Map DBpedia entities and properties to Wikidata using ER2:**\n   - `dbo:Album` \u2192 `wd:Q482994`.\n   - `dbo:artist` \u2192 `p:P175`.\n   - `res:Elvis_Presley` \u2192 `wd:Q303`.\n   - `dbo:releaseDate` \u2192 `p:P577`.\n   - `dbo:recordLabel` \u2192 `p:P264`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query using Wikidata prefixes and syntax:**\n   - Use `p:` for property prefixes.\n   - Use `wd:` for entity prefixes.\n   - Apply the same structure: select the record label, ensure the artist is Elvis Presley, sort by release date, and fetch only the earliest album.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for KG2 (Wikidata):**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?label\nWHERE \n{\n  ?album wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ;\n         p:P175 ?artist ;\n         p:P577 ?date ;\n         p:P264 ?label .\n  ?artist wdt:P175 wd:Q303 .\n}\nORDER BY (?date)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to get the runtime of Toy Story. Let me start by looking at the information provided.\n\nFrom the context, I see that there's a Knowledge Graph 1 (DBpedia) where the SPARQL query is already given. It uses the dbo:runtime property to fetch the runtime of Toy Story. Now, I need to map these entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2), I see that the DBpedia resource for Toy Story (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toy_Story) maps to Wikidata's Q171048. Similarly, the DBpedia ontology property dbo:runtime maps to Wikidata's P2047, which represents runtime.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the entity for Toy Story is Q171048, and the property to get the runtime is P2047. I need to construct a SPARQL query that retrieves the runtime value for this specific entity.\n\nI'll start by defining the prefixes for Wikidata. Typically, the prefix for the entity is 'wd', and for properties, it's 'p' or 'wds'. But I can define them as needed for clarity.\n\nThe structure of the query should select the runtime where the subject is Q171048 and the predicate is P2047. Since in Wikidata, properties are often represented with a specific syntax, especially when dealing with quantities or values, I might need to use a qualifier or ensure that the property is correctly referenced.\n\nWait, actually in Wikidata SPARQL, properties are accessed using the 'p' or 'ps' prefixes. For example, 'wdtn:P2047' might be how it's referenced, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check. Oh, right, sometimes the property is 'wdt:P2047' without the 'n' because 'wdt' stands for Wikidata tangent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the query should select ?runtime where the entity Q171048 has the property P2047 with the value ?runtime.\n\nI also need to make sure that the prefixes are correctly declared. Typically, 'wd' points to http://www.wikidata.org/entity/, and 'wdt' is for the properties.\n\nLet me write this down step by step:\n\n1. Prefix declaration for Wikidata entities: PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n2. Prefix declaration for Wikidata properties: PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n3. Select statement to retrieve the runtime: SELECT ?runtime\n4. From the entity Q171048, we look for the property P2047 and its value.\n5. So the WHERE clause becomes: WHERE { wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime }\n\nI should also ensure that I'm using the correct syntax and that the property is correctly referenced as a direct property. I don't think I need any additional filters or conditions since I'm only querying for a specific entity.\n\nLet me assemble the full query with the prefixes and the WHERE clause. I'll make sure to format it correctly and include the semicolon after the prefix declarations.\n\nWait, no, in SPARQL, the prefix declarations don't end with semicolons; they end with periods or are just lines in the query. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, the final query should look like this:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?runtime\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime\n}\n\nI think that's it. This query should fetch the runtime of Toy Story from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first map the DBpedia entities and properties to their corresponding Wikidata counterparts. The movie \"Toy Story\" in DBpedia is Q171048 in Wikidata, and the property \"runtime\" is P2047. Using these mappings, the query retrieves the runtime of Toy Story from Wikidata.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?runtime\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q171048 wdt:P2047 ?runtime\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that finds all trumpet players who were also bandleaders. I remember that the original query for DBpedia was using specific prefixes and properties. Let me try to map this over to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, the original query used dbo:occupation and set it to res:Bandleader. From the ER2 mapping, dbo:occupation corresponds to Wikidata's P106, which is 'occupation'. Similarly, res:Bandleader maps to Q5280538 and Q806349 in Wikidata. So for the occupation part, in Wikidata, I would use the property wdtn:P106 and the items wd:Q5280538 and wd:Q806349.\n\nNext, the original query used dbo:instrument and res:Trumpet. The mapping shows that dbo:instrument is P1303 in Wikidata, and res:Trumpet maps to Q119621 and Q8338. So I'll need to use the property wdtn:P1303 with these item codes.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select distinct items where the occupation is Bandleader and the instrument is Trumpet. I also need to declare the prefixes for Wikidata. \n\nWait, how exactly do the prefixes look in Wikidata? I think the standard prefix is wd for entities and wdt for properties. So I would use PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nSo, the structure would be: select distinct ?uri where ?uri has occupation Bandleader and instrument Trumpet. That translates into two triple patterns: one for occupation and one for instrument.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct item identifiers. So for Bandleader, I can include both Q5280538 and Q806349, and for Trumpet, include Q119621 and Q8338. Using 'VALUES' might be the right approach here to cover all possible items, or maybe use a union, but I think for this purpose, using the specific items with 'in' might work. Wait, no, the 'in' operator isn't available in SPARQL, but I can use multiple triple patterns with semicolons since the same subject is being used.\n\nWait, actually, in SPARQL, using semicolons allows you to add multiple properties for the same subject, so I can write the conditions as ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538; wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338. But what if there are multiple Bandleader or Trumpet entries? For Bandleader, the ER2 shows two possible Q codes. So maybe I should include both. How to handle multiple possibilities? Perhaps using the VALUES clause. For example, VALUES (?occupation) { (wd:Q5280538) (wd:Q806349) } and similarly for instruments. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but necessary to cover all cases.\n\nAlternatively, I can write separate triple patterns for each possible value, but that could get lengthy. Using VALUES might be more efficient.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to use multiple 'wdt' statements connected with a semicolon and use 'VALUES' for each property. So:\n\n?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader .\n?bandleader ?occupation .\nBut no, that's not directly applicable. Maybe I need to structure it as:\n\n?uri wdt:P106 [ wd:Q5280538 ; wd:Q806349 ].\n\nNo, that's not correct. Each property needs to be specified separately. Alternatively, I can use a filter with '||' but that's not efficient. Perhaps it's better to include all possible values using 'VALUES' for the variables.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to structure it as:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P106 ?occ .\n    ?uri wdt:P1303 ?inst .\n    FILTER( ?occ = wd:Q5280538 || ?occ = wd:Q806349 )\n    FILTER( ?inst = wd:Q119621 || ?inst = wd:Q8338 )\n}\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, using the 'in' operator, which is allowed in SPARQL, like:\n\n?uri wdt:P106 ?occ FILTER( ?occ IN (wd:Q5280538, wd:Q806349) )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct syntax.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list the possible values in the query using multiple options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use two separate triples for each condition.\n\nBut maybe the simpler way is to just use the specific item for Bandleader and Trumpet as the most common ones and proceed.\n\nWait, the original DBpedia query used 'Bandleader' and 'Trumpet' as fixed resources. So in Wikidata, I can use their direct mappings. So, the query would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538 ;\n          wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338 .\n}\n\nBut this might miss other possible bandleader or trumpet entries. To be thorough, perhaps I need to cover all possible cases.\n\nBut for the sake of this example, maybe it's enough to use the primary items.\n\nWait, no, the ER2 shows that 'Bandleader' in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata items, Q5280538 and Q806349. Similarly, 'Trumpet' maps to Q119621 and Q8338. So I should include all possibilities to capture all relevant entities.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the right approach is to include all options by using multiple triple patterns or using the 'values' clause.\n\nSo, rewriting, the query would include four conditions:\n\n1. ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q5280538\n2. ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q806349\n3. ?uri wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621\n4. ?uri wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338\n\nBut how to combine these in a single query? Using 'UNION' could be an option, but that might complicate the query and return duplicates.\n\nAnother approach is to use 'VALUES' to specify possible values for each property and then use them in the query.\n\nSo, the query would look something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    VALUES ?bandleader { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n    VALUES ?trumpet { wd:Q119621 wd:Q8338 }\n    ?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader ;\n        wdt:P1303 ?trumpet .\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if the syntax allows 'VALUES' for two variables in the same query. Alternatively, maybe I can nest the values.\n\nWait, perhaps using 'VALUES' for each property and then using those variables in the triples.\n\nLet me try:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    VALUES ?bandleader { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n    ?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader .\n    VALUES ?instrument { wd:Q119621 wd:Q8338 }\n    ?uri wdt:P1303 ?instrument .\n}\n\nThis way, it checks for any combination of Bandleader and Trumpet.\n\nBut I think in SPARQL, the 'VALUES' clause is used once, so perhaps I can combine all into one.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P106 [ wd:Q5280538 ; wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621 ] .\n    UNION\n    ?uri wdt:P106 [ wd:Q5280538 ; wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338 ] .\n    UNION\n    ?uri wdt:P106 [ wd:Q806349 ; wdt:P1303 wd:Q119621 ] .\n    UNION\n    ?uri wdt:P106 [ wd:Q806349 ; wdt:P1303 wd:Q8338 ] .\n}\n\nBut this seems very redundant. There must be a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps using 'VALUES' for both properties.\n\nLike:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    VALUES ?bandleader { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n    VALUES ?instrument { wd:Q119621 wd:Q8338 }\n    ?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader ;\n        wdt:P1303 ?instrument .\n}\n\nI think this should work, checking all combinations of Bandleader and Trumpet.\n\nSo, with that in mind, the final query would use the 'VALUES' clause for both bandleader and instrument, and the properties wdt:P106 and wdt:P1303.\n\nI also need to make sure to use the correct prefixes, so PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should look something like that.\n</think>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the target knowledge graph and required SPARQL syntax.** The target is Wikidata, which uses specific prefixes for entities and properties.\n\n2. **Map the original DBpedia query components to Wikidata using the provided ER2.**\n   - **dbo:occupation** \u2192 **wdt:P106** (occupation)\n   - **res:Bandleader** \u2192 **wd:Q5280538, wd:Q806349** (Bandleader)\n   - **dbo:instrument** \u2192 **wdt:P1303** (instrument)\n   - **res:Trumpet** \u2192 **wd:Q119621, wd:Q8338** (Trumpet)\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query structure.**\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique entities.\n   - Include `VALUES` clauses for both occupation and instrument to account for all possible values.\n   - Link each entity with the respective properties using `wdt:P106` and `wdt:P1303`.\n\nFinal SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    VALUES ?bandleader { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n    VALUES ?instrument { wd:Q119621 wd:Q8338 }\n    ?uri wdt:P106 ?bandleader ;\n        wdt:P1303 ?instrument .\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

It selects films that are directed by Garry Marshall and star Julia Roberts. The key elements are the film URI, the starring relationship, and the director.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia Film ontology corresponds to Wikidata's Q11424. The starring property maps to P161, and the director to P57.

Let's start by understanding what the original query does for DBpedia.\n\nThe original query uses DBpedia's ontology and resources. It selects the birth year of Rachel Stevens by querying the dbo:birthYear property. But now, I need to switch this to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I should look at the ER2 mapping provided. For Rachel Stevens, the DBpedia ID maps to Wikidata's Q241665. So, in Wikidata, Rachel Stevens is represented by this ID.\n\nNext, the property dbo:birthYear in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P569, which stands for \"date of birth.\" This means I need to use P569 in my SPARQL query.\n\nWikidata uses the prefix wdt: for properties, so the property will be wdt:P569. The entity in Wikidata is referred to as wd:Q241665.\n\nIn SPARQL, I need to select the variable that holds the birth year. So, I'll write a SELECT query. The structure should be something like selecting the year where Rachel Stevens has the date of birth property.\n\nI also remember that in Wikidata, for literals, you don't need to specify the URI. So I'll write the WHERE clause to match the entity and property.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll use the WDQS endpoint and the necessary prefixes for Wikidata. The query will ask for the year where wd:Q241665 has wdt:P569. I'll select distinct to get unique results.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the syntax is correct, using braces for the WHERE block and semicolons where necessary.

The query should select the cause of death that appears most frequently, so I'll need to count the occurrences of each cause.\n\nI'll start by writing a SELECT statement with a COUNT function. The variable will be ?cause, and I'll count the number of times each cause occurs. \n\nNext, I'll need to structure the query in triples. The subject will be the item, the predicate is 'wds:P509', and the object is the cause. So, it'll look like: ?item wds:P509 ?cause.\n\nSince Wikidata doesn't use graph names like DBpedia, I don't need to specify a FROM clause. I'll just use the default graph.\n\nAfter counting, I need to group the results by the cause and order them in descending order based on the count. This will help me find the most frequent cause. I'll use GROUP BY for grouping and ORDER BY with the count in descending order.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select each cause, count how many times it occurs, group by the cause, and then order those groups from highest to lowest count. Finally, I'll limit the results to just the top one to get the most frequent cause.\n\nI should test this logic to make sure it's correct. Let me see: does Wikidata handle COUNT and GROUP BY correctly? Yes, I think it does. Also, using DESC in the ORDER BY ensures the highest count comes first.\n\nSo, the final SPARQL query should include all these elements: selecting the cause, counting, grouping, ordering, and limiting to one result.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first need to identify the equivalent property for `deathCause` from DBpedia. According to the ER2 mapping provided, the equivalent property in Wikidata is `P509`. \n\nNext, we want to count the number of times each cause of death appears in the data and order the results by frequency in descending order. In Wikidata, we can achieve this by using the `COUNT` function, which counts the number of distinct entities for each cause of death.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Select the cause of death (`?cause`) and count the number of times it appears (`COUNT(DISTINCT ?item)`)**:\n   - This will give us a list of causes of death along with their frequency.\n\n2. **Filter entities that have a cause of death (`?item wds:P509 ?cause`)**:\n   - This triple pattern retrieves all items (`?item`) that have a cause of death (`P509`) associated with them.\n\n3. **Group the results by cause of death (`GROUP BY ?cause`)**:\n   - This groups the results so that we can aggregate the count for each specific cause of death.\n\n4. **Order the results by frequency in descending order (`ORDER BY DESC(COUNT(DISTINCT ?item))`)**:\n   - This ensures that the most frequent cause of death appears first.\n\n5. **Limit the results to the top cause of death (`LIMIT 1`)**:\n   - This returns only the most frequent cause of death.\n\nPutting it all together, the final SPARQL query is as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?cause (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?item wds:P509 ?cause .\n}\nGROUP BY ?cause\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in the DBpedia query provided, the prefix 'dbo' is used for the ontology and 'res' for the resource. The query selects the height of Yokohama_Marine_Tower using the property dbo:height. So, in Wikidata, I'll need to find the equivalent entities and properties.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia resource for Yokohama_Marine_Tower maps to Wikidata's Q1207989. Also, the DBpedia ontology for height (dbo:height) maps to Wikidata's property P2048.\n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata. I'll start by defining the prefixes for Wikidata's entity and property namespaces. Typically, 'wd' is used for entities and 'wdt' for properties.\n\nThe structure of the SPARQL query should be similar to the DBpedia one. I'll select the height value, so I'll use ?num as the variable. The main entity is wd:Q1207989, and the property is wdt:P2048.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will look like this: select ?num where the entity has the property P2048, and we return the distinct value to avoid duplicates.\n\nI should double-check if there are any specific prefixes or namespaces that Wikidata requires. I think 'wd' and 'wdt' are standard. Also, ensuring that the SELECT DISTINCT clause is correctly placed to get the exact value.\n\nSo, the final query should correctly fetch the height of the Yokohama Marine Tower from Wikidata using the mapped entities and properties.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the entities from DBpedia to those in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mappings. Specifically, Yokohama Marine Tower in DBpedia corresponds to Q1207989 in Wikidata, and the height property (dbo:height) maps to P2048 in Wikidata. Using the WD and WDT prefixes for Wikidata entities and properties respectively, the query is formed.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?height \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1207989 wdt:P2048 ?height\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original query is for DBpedia, but I need to switch this to Wikidata. The question is about finding the highest mountain in Italy.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that the DBpedia classes and properties have corresponding Wikidata entities. For example, dbo:Mountain in DBpedia maps to wikidata:Q8502. So, in the SPARQL query, I'll use Q8502 to denote mountains.\n\nNext, the locatedInArea property in DBpedia is P131 in Wikidata. That means I should use P131 to find where the mountain is located.\n\nThe resource for Italy in DBpedia is res:Italy, which maps to Q38 in Wikidata. So I'll use wd:Q38 to represent Italy in the query.\n\nElevation is another property needed. In DBpedia, it's dbo:elevation, and in Wikidata, it's P2044. So I'll use P2044 to get the elevation value.\n\nSince SPARQL in Wikidata typically uses the wd prefix for entities and the p prefix for properties, I'll adjust the prefixes accordingly. Also, I'll include the wikidata rdf type, which is wdt:P31, to specify that the entity is a mountain.\n\nNow, I need to structure the WHERE clause. The query should select entities that are mountains, located in Italy, and have an elevation value. Once I have all the mountains in Italy, I want to order them by elevation in descending order to find the highest one.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write a SELECT query that fetches the mountain URI and its elevation. Then, I'll use ORDER BY to sort by elevation in descending order and limit the result to just the top one.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax for Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint. That includes using PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> for direct properties and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> for entities.\n\nFinally, I'll test the query structure to ensure there are no syntax errors, like missing semicolons or incorrect use of prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding entities in Wikidata. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the entities and properties in the original DBpedia query:**\n   - `dbo:Mountain` (Mountain class)\n   - `dbo:locatedInArea` (located in area property)\n   - `res:Italy` (Italy resource)\n   - `dbo:elevation` (elevation property)\n\n2. **Map these entities to Wikidata using the ER2 mapping:**\n   - `dbo:Mountain` maps to `wikidata:Q8502`\n   - `dbo:locatedInArea` maps to `wikidata:P131`\n   - `res:Italy` maps to `wikidata:Q38`\n   - `dbo:elevation` maps to `wikidata:P2044`\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declarations to abbreviate the URLs.\n   - Use `?uri` to represent the mountain entities.\n   - Use `wdt:P31` to assert that `?uri` is an instance of `wd:Q8502` (Mountain).\n   - Use `wdt:P131` to state that the mountain is located in `wd:Q38` (Italy).\n   - Use `wdt:P2044` to retrieve the elevation value.\n   - Order the results by elevation in descending order.\n   - Limit the results to the highest mountain.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri ?elevation\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ;  # ?uri is a mountain\n        wdt:P131 wd:Q38 ;    # located in Italy\n        wdt:P2044 ?elevation # has elevation\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will return the highest mountain in Italy by elevation."

The original query used DBpedia, but now I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the ER2 mapping, Donald Trump in DBpedia corresponds to Q22686 in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, I should use wd:Q22686 to represent him. That makes sense because each entity in Wikidata has a Q number, so Q22686 is Donald Trump.\n\nNext, the original query in DBpedia used dbo:owner to find what Trump owns. Looking at the ER2 mapping, dbo:owner (which is owner in DBpedia's ontology) maps to P127 in Wikidata, which is \"owned by.\" So, in Wikidata, the property I should use is wdt:P127 because that's the predicate for \"owned by.\" \n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query. In Wikidata, the prefix for the data is usually wd, and for the ontology, it's wdt. So, I'll use these prefixes at the beginning of the query. \n\nThe goal is to find what entities are owned by Donald Trump. So, the query should ask for all items ?item such that the item is owned by Donald Trump. In SPARQL, that translates to a WHERE clause with ?item wdt:P127 wd:Q22686.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the prefixes, then the SELECT statement to get ?item. In the WHERE clause, I'll connect ?item with wdt:P127 to wd:Q22686. I don't think I need any additional conditions because the main goal is to list all items owned by Trump.\n\nWait, should I include any labels or filters? The original query just asked for the owner, so in this case, since we're looking for the items he owns, maybe I don't need labels unless I want to display their names. But the main thing is to get the items, so I'll stick with the basic query without any additional options.\n\nTherefore, the SPARQL query should be straightforward, selecting ?item where ?item is owned by Trump. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes and structure it properly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to identify the corresponding entities and properties. Donald Trump's Wikidata ID is Q22686, and the \"owner\" property is P127. We want to find all items owned by Trump, so the query selects ?item where ?item has P127 and the object is Q22686.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Prefixes:** Use `wd` and `wdt` for Wikidata entities and properties.\n2. **SELECT:** Retrieve the ?item variable.\n3. **WHERE Clause:** Filter for items with property P127 (owned by) where the owner is Q22686 (Donald Trump).\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P127 wd:Q22686\n}\n```\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?item \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P127 wd:Q22686\n}\n</sparql>"

In DBpedia, the property 'spouse' is <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse>, and Tom Cruise's resource is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise>.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia spouse property maps to Wikidata's P26. Also, Tom Cruise's DBpedia resource maps to Wikidata's Q37079. So I need to translate the DBpedia properties and resources to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\nIn Wikidata, the property for spouse is P26, but in SPARQL, it's written as wdt:P26. Also, items in Wikidata are referred to by their Q numbers, so 'wd:Q37079' is Tom Cruise.\n\nSo, in the original query, we're looking for all ?uri such that ?uri is the spouse of Tom Cruise. But in Wikidata, the direction might be different. I think in Wikidata, Tom Cruise would have the P26 property pointing to his spouses, so the query should be selecting the objects of that property for Tom Cruise.\n\nTherefore, the structure would be SELECT ?uri WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079> wdt:P26 ?uri }. This way, we're getting all the entities connected via P26 to Tom Cruise.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes in the SPARQL query, which in this case, the 'wd' prefix is commonly used for Wikidata, pointing to 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/'.\n\nSo putting it all together, the SELECT clause is straightforward, and the WHERE clause specifies the triple with Tom Cruise as the subject, P26 as the predicate, and the spouse as the object. Using the correct syntax for Wikidata, with the 'wd' prefix, ensures the query works as intended.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Query:**\n   - The original SPARQL query for DBpedia retrieves the URIs of all entities that are spouses of Tom Cruise.\n   - It uses the DBpedia-specific property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse>` to represent the \"spouse\" relationship.\n   - Tom Cruise is represented in DBpedia by the URI `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise>`.\n\n2. **Mapping to Wikidata:**\n   - The Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2) provides the corresponding Wikidata identifiers.\n   - The \"spouse\" relationship in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/spouse>`) corresponds to Wikidata property `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P26>`.\n   - Tom Cruise in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Cruise>`) corresponds to Wikidata entity `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37079>`.\n\n3. **Constructing the Wikidata SPARQL Query:**\n   - In Wikidata, the property for \"spouse\" is `P26`, and it is queried using the `wdt:P26` predicate in SPARQL.\n   - The entity for Tom Cruise in Wikidata is `Q37079`, and it is represented as `wd:Q37079` in SPARQL.\n   - The spouse relationship in Wikidata is represented from the subject (Tom Cruise) to the object (his spouses).\n\n4. **Final Query Construction:**\n   - The query selects the objects (`?uri`) where Tom Cruise (`wd:Q37079`) is the subject and `P26` is the predicate.\n   - This is constructed as `SELECT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?uri }`.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q37079 wdt:P26 ?uri }\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to construct a SPARQL query for the Wikidata knowledge graph to find out how many people live in Eurasia. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in SPARQL, you start by defining the prefix for the dataset. Since we're using Wikidata, the common prefixes are 'wd' for the entities and 'wds' for the statements. So I'll set those prefixes at the beginning of the query.\n\nNext, I remember that in the original DBpedia query, they used res:Eurasia and dbo:populationTotal. From the entity and relation mapping provided, I see that res:Eurasia in DBpedia corresponds to http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5401 in Wikidata. Similarly, dbo:populationTotal maps to P1082 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the main entity I'm querying is Q5401, which is Eurasia. Then, I need to find the property that corresponds to the total population. That's P1082. But I also recall that in Wikidata, properties often have a 'claims' part, so I should use wds:P1082.\n\nNow, when querying for a specific property, I need to specify where to look. In Wikidata, I think that the population value might have a point-in-time qualifier, so I should include that to filter the data correctly. Otherwise, I might get multiple values or outdated data.\n\nI also want to make sure that I'm selecting distinct results to avoid duplicates. So I'll start the query with SELECT DISTINCT.\n\nPutting it all together, I have the PREFIX lines, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause. In the WHERE clause, I'll specify the Eurasia entity, the population property, and the population predicate. Finally, I'll add a time filter to get the most recent or appropriate data.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure if I need to specify a time range. Maybe just getting the current or latest population is enough. So I'll include the FILTER to get the most recent data points.\n\nLet me double-check the mappings to ensure I didn't mix up any IDs. The DBpedia Eurasia maps to Q5401, and populationTotal maps to P1082. Yes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, the final query should correctly fetch the population of Eurasia from Wikidata using the specified entities and properties.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding identifiers in Wikidata and adjust the query syntax accordingly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Prefixes**: The first step is to define the prefixes that correspond to the Wikidata namespace. In Wikidata, we commonly use `wd` for entities and `wds` for statements about those entities.\n\n2. **SELECT Clause**: We select the variable `?population` to retrieve the population value.\n\n3. **WHERE Clause**: This specifies the main entities and properties we are querying:\n   - **Entity**: We use `wd:Q5401` to refer to Eurasia, as mapped from DBpedia's `res:Eurasia`.\n   - **Property**: The property `wds:P1082` is used to denote \"population total,\" which corresponds to DBpedia's `dbo:populationTotal`.\n\n4. **FILTER**: This ensures we only retrieve numeric values for the population.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n```sparql\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?population\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q5401 wds:P1082 ?population .\n  FILTER (xsd:integer(?population))\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the total population of Eurasia from Wikidata, ensuring the result is a numeric value."

In ER2, I see that \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q726382. So the entity in Wikidata is Q726382.\n\nNext, the property 'author' in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P50, which stands for 'author.' So in Wikidata, authors are linked using the P50 property.\n\nNow, in SPARQL queries for Wikidata, it's common to use the 'wd:' prefix for entities and 'p:' or 'ps:' for properties. The structure usually involves selecting the variable, which in this case would be the author.\n\nSo, putting this together, I'll start with the PREFIX declarations for Wikidata. Then, I'll construct a SELECT query to get the author. The WHERE clause will specify that the entity Q726382 has the property P50, and the object of that property is the author we want.\n\nI think the correct syntax would be using 'ps:' for the property. So, the query should look something like selecting ?author where wd:Q726382 has ps:P50 ?author.\n\nWait, is there a difference between 'p:' and 'ps:'? I think 'p:' is for the statement, and 'ps:' is for the specific property. So using 'ps:P50' is correct for the property.\n\nLet me make sure I have the prefixes right. Wikidata usually uses 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/' for entities, so 'wd' will be the prefix for that. 'wds:' might not be standard; perhaps it's better to use just 'wd' for entities and 'p' or 'ps' for properties.\n\nSo, the final query should have PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and then use wd:Q726382 for the entity and ps:P50 for the author property.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we start by identifying the relevant entity and property from the ER mapping. The entity \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" is Q726382 in Wikidata, and the property for 'author' is P50. Using these, the query selects the author linked to Q726382 via P50.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **PREFIX Definitions:**\n   - `wd:` is used for Wikidata entities.\n   - `ps:` denotes the property statement for 'author' (P50).\n\n2. **Query Construction:**\n   - SELECT ?author retrieves the variable of interest.\n   - The WHERE clause specifies that the entity Q726382 should have the P50 property, with the author as the object.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT ?author WHERE {\n  wd:Q726382 ps:P50 ?author\n}\n```"

Now, they want to switch to using Wikidata, so I need to map that property correctly.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, the dbpedia_id for birthDate is linked to Wikidata's P569. That means in Wikidata, the property to use is wdt:P569.\n\nNext, I need the correct entity in Wikidata for John Adams. From the ER2, the DBpedia resource John_Adams maps to Q11806 in Wikidata. So, the entity is wd:Q11806.\n\nPutting it together, the SPARQL query will select the birthDate where John Adams (wd:Q11806) has the P569 property. I should make sure to use the PREFIX statements appropriately for Wikidata, using wdt and wd prefixes.\n\nI shouldn't forget to make the date variable distinct to avoid duplicates.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given information. Let me start by carefully understanding each part of the provided context.\n\nFirst, the natural language question is asking for the total population of the European Union. That's straightforward.\n\nThe SPARQL query given is for DBpedia. It uses the prefix dbo for the ontology and dbr for the resources. The query selects ?europop where European_Union has the populationTotal property. So, in DBpedia, they're using dbo:populationTotal to get the population number.\n\nNow, looking at the second knowledge graph, which is Wikidata, I need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. The ER2 provides the necessary mappings. \n\nIn ER2, the first entry maps the DBpedia resource for European_Union to Wikidata's Q458. The second entry maps DBpedia's populationTotal to Wikidata's P1082, which is the population property.\n\nSo, the task is to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the same information as the DBpedia query but using Wikidata's entities and properties.\n\nI know that in SPARQL, we use PREFIX to define the namespaces. For Wikidata, the common prefix is wd, which points to http://www.wikidata.org/entity/. The properties in Wikidata are usually named like wdt:P followed by the property code, so population would be wdt:P1082.\n\nThe query structure in SPARQL typically starts with SELECT, then the variable(s) we want to retrieve. In this case, we want the population, so we'll select ?population. \n\nNext, we need to specify the main entity, which is the European Union. The ER2 tells us that it's identified as Q458 in Wikidata. So, the subject in our triple will be wd:Q458.\n\nThe property we're interested in is population, which maps to P1082 in Wikidata. In SPARQL, we use wdt:P1082 for the property.\n\nPutting it all together, the triple pattern will be:\nwd:Q458 wdt:P1082 ?population\n\nThis means we're looking for the population of the European Union in Wikidata.\n\nSo the complete query structure would be:\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?population WHERE {\n  wd:Q458 wdt:P1082 ?population\n}\n\nI need to make sure that the prefixes are correctly defined. Sometimes, people use different prefixes, but wd is standard for Wikidata. Also, the property is correctly referenced using wdt:P1082.\n\nI should also consider if there are any additional constraints or modifiers, but in this case, the query is simple. We just need the total population, so no further filters are necessary.\n\nI think that's all. The query is straightforward, and the reasoning follows the mappings provided.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we replace DBpedia's entities and properties with their Wikidata counterparts using the provided mappings. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Subject (European Union):** Mapped from DBpedia's `dbr:European_Union` to Wikidata's `wd:Q458`.\n2. **Property (Population):** Mapped from DBpedia's `dbo:populationTotal` to Wikidata's `wdt:P1082`.\n3. **Variable:** Use `?population` to hold the result.\n4. **Prefixes:** Define `wd` for Wikidata entities and properties.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?population WHERE {\n  wd:Q458 wdt:P1082 ?population\n}\n```"

I remember that they already have a query for DBpedia, but now they want to use Wikidata instead. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the existing query for DBpedia. It uses the prefixes dbo and res, and it selects the ?uri where res:China has the dbo:currency property. So, the structure is similar to what I'll need for Wikidata, but the prefixes and properties will be different.\n\nThe user provided an ER2 mapping which links the DBpedia resources to Wikidata entities. I'll need to map \"China\" and \"currency\" from DBpedia to their corresponding Wikidata IDs. From the ER2, I see that DBpedia's \"China\" corresponds to several Wikidata entities, including Q148, which I think is the main one for the country. For the currency property in DBpedia, it maps to Wikidata's P38.\n\nSo, I'll start by setting up the PREFIXES for Wikidata. Instead of dbo and res, I'll use wdt and wd. The wdt prefix is for the data properties, and wd is for the entity IDs.\n\nNext, in the SELECT clause, I'll ask for ?value since that's the variable that usually holds the actual value in Wikidata queries. I'll use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates.\n\nThe main part is the WHERE clause. I'll specify that the entity wd:Q148 (China) should have the property wdt:P38 (currency). This will return the value associated with that property, which should be the currency's name.\n\nI should also make sure to use the right syntax and structure for the SPARQL query in Wikidata. Testing it directly in the Wikidata query service could help verify if it works, but since I can't do that right now, I'll double-check the mappings and properties to ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, should I specify any labels or use additional constraints? I don't think so because the query is straightforward\u2014just fetching the currency value. No need for extra variables unless required for clarity, but in this case, it's simple.\n\nI think that's it. The query should effectively retrieve the official currency of China from Wikidata using the mapped properties. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the entity for China**: In DBpedia, the entity is `res:China`. From the ER2 mapping, the corresponding Wikidata entities are `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q148` (primary entity for China).\n\n2. **Identify the property for currency**: In DBpedia, the property is `dbo:currency`. From the ER2 mapping, the corresponding Wikidata property is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P38` (property for \"currency\").\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**: Using the Wikidata prefixes `wd:` for entities and `wdt:` for property values, we can query for the currency of China.\n\nHere's the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?value \nWHERE \n{ \n  wd:Q148 wdt:P38 ?value \n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the currency of China from the Wikidata knowledge graph."

Let me start by looking at the information provided. \n\nFirst, the original query is for DBpedia, and it's selecting all URIs that are instances of Rocket and have a launchSite of Baikonur_Cosmodrome. So, I need to map these DBpedia entities and properties to Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER2 mapping.\n\nIn ER2, the DBpedia Rocket is mapped to Wikidata's Q41291. So, in Wikidata, I'll look for entities with P31 (instance of) and the value wd:Q41291.\n\nNext, the launchSite property in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P448. That means I'll use P448 in the query. The value should be the Wikidata ID for Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is Q177477, so I'll use wd:Q177477.\n\nPutting this together, for each rocket, I'll need to state that it's an instance of Rocket and that its launch site is Baikonur. So, the SPARQL structure should include these two triples. I'll keep the prefix wdt: for the statements and wd: for the entities.\n\nI should also consider variable names to make it clear, so I'll use ?rocket as the main variable. The DISTINCT keyword is important to avoid duplicates. \n\nI don't think I need any additional triples beyond the two, but I should make sure the query is correctly formatted. Also, since the user wants JSON output, I'll include that format specification.\n\nLet me double-check the mappings to ensure I'm using the right codes. Rocket is Q41291, launch site is P448, and Baikonur is Q177477. Everything looks correct. \n\nNow, structuring the query: I'll start with the PREFIX section, define the query with DISTINCT, and then write the WHERE clause with the two triples. Finally, include the format statement.\n\nI think that's all. I'll write it out step by step and then present the final query.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Knowledge Graph and Requirements:**\n   - The task is to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the provided mappings.\n   - The goal is to retrieve rockets launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, similar to the DBpedia query.\n\n2. **Analyze the DBpedia Query and ER2 Mapping:**\n   - The DBpedia query retrieves URIs of entities that are of type \"Rocket\" and have a \"launchSite\" relationship with \"Baikonur_Cosmodrome\".\n\n3. **Map DBpedia Entities and Properties to Wikidata:**\n   - **Rocket Class (DBpedia):** Mapped to \"Q41291\" in Wikidata (wd:Q41291).\n   - **launchSite Property (DBpedia):** Mapped to \"P448\" in Wikidata (wdt:P448).\n   - **Baikonur_Cosmodrome (DBpedia):** Mapped to \"Q177477\" in Wikidata (wd:Q177477).\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declaration for Wikidata prefixes.\n   - Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate results.\n   - Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the triples that match the criteria:\n     - The item must be an instance of \"Rocket\" (`wd:Q41291`).\n     - The item must have a \"launch site\" (`wdt:P448`) relationship with \"Baikonur Cosmodrome\" (`wd:Q177477`).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?rocket\nWHERE \n{\n  ?rocket wdt:P31 wd:Q41291 ;\n           wdt:P448 wd:Q177477 .\n}\nFORMAT JSON\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the user create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out who developed the video game World of Warcraft. They've already provided a similar query for DBpedia, and they want the same but for Wikidata now. Let me break this down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I remember that the original query used DBpedia's ontology and resources. It selected the URI where World of Warcraft has a developer property. That makes sense for DBpedia. But now, since we're moving to Wikidata, things are a bit different. I need to use Wikidata's prefixes and properties instead.\n\nSo, the first thing I think about is the prefixes. In Wikidata, the main prefix is usually just 'wd', and the ontology prefix is 'wds'. So I'll start my query with PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and PREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/ontology#>.\n\nNext, the original query was looking for res:World_of_Warcraft. From the ER2 mapping, I see that World of Warcraft in DBpedia maps to http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q131007 in Wikidata. So I need to use wd:Q131007 as my resource here.\n\nNow, the developer property. In DBpedia, it was dbo:developer, but according to ER2, that maps to P178 in Wikidata. So the property I need is wds:P178. Wait, no, in SPARQL, for properties, you just use the predicate directly. So I should check if it's p178 or something else. Actually, in Wikidata, properties are accessed via the 'p' namespace with their ID, but sometimes you might need to use the full URI. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the full URI for clarity.\n\nWait, looking back, the ER2 mapping shows \"wikidata_ids\": [\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P178\"], so that should be the property we need to use. So in SPARQL, to get the value of P178 for a resource, we use the property wd:P178. Or perhaps it's better to use the full URI, like <http://www.wikidata.org/property/P178>. I think both work, but using the prefix is cleaner.\n\nSo putting this together, the WHERE clause should link the World of Warcraft entity to the developer property and get the value. So the structure would be:\n\nwd:Q131007 wds:P178 ?uri .\n\nWait, no, I think I mixed that up. The correct way is to use the property as the predicate. So it should be wd:Q131007 <http://www.wikidata.org/property/P178> ?uri. But using the prefix, it would be wd:Q131007 wds:P178 ?uri.\n\nWait, no, the correct syntax is to use the property directly. So since P178 is a property, in SPARQL, I can write it as wd:P178. Wait no, that's not right. Properties are in the 'p' namespace. So I think it's better written as <http://www.wikidata.org/property/P178>, but using the prefix, it becomes wds:P178. So the correct way is wd:Q131007 wds:P178 ?uri.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check. In Wikidata, the property for developer is P178, and the NS is wds. So the predicate should be wds:P178. So the triple is subject: Q131007, predicate: P178, object: ?uri.\n\nAlso, since 'developer' can have multiple values, using SELECT DISTINCT ensures we get each developer only once.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should start with the prefixes, then the SELECT DISTINCT ?uri, and the WHERE clause with the triple.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/ontology#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q131007 wds:P178 ?uri.\n}\n\nWait, but sometimes in Wikidata, you need to use a different approach because properties are stored differently, often using qualifiers and such, but in this case, we're just looking for the main value. So this should work.\n\nI think that's it. So the final query would select the distinct URIs where World of Warcraft has the P178 property.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Goal:** We need to find who developed World of Warcraft using Wikidata's SPARQL query.\n\n2. **Identify the Resource and Property in Wikidata:**\n   - **World of Warcraft:** Mapped from DBpedia to Wikidata as Q131007.\n   - **Developer Property:** Mapped from DBpedia's 'developer' to Wikidata's P178.\n\n3. **Construct SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use Wikidata prefixes.\n   - Select the URI of the developer.\n   - Use the WHERE clause to link the game and the developer property.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/ontology#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q131007 wds:P178 ?uri.\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user generate a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the example provided for DBpedia. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The original query is about finding all companies in the advertising industry, and it uses DBpedia's ontology and resources. The user has provided entity and relation mappings between DBpedia and Wikidata, which I can use to construct the query for Wikidata.\n\nFirst, in the original SPARQL query for DBpedia, it's selecting the count of distinct company URIs. The where clause has a union of two parts: one explicitly stating the industry is Advertising, and another that does a regex match on the industry label for \"advertising\". The Wilidata query should mirror this logic but using Wilidata's entities and properties.\n\nLooking at the entity mapping, the DBpedia Company ontology corresponds to Wikidata's Q4830453. So in Wilidata, I'll need to use wd:Q4830453. Next, the industry property in DBpedia is mapped to Wilidata's P452. So, I'll replace the DBpedia industry predicate with P452.\n\nFor the industry values, DBpedia's Advertising is mapped to three Wilidata entities: Q854995, Q37038, and Q1286627. That means in Wilidata, the company's industry could be any of these three. Instead of using a URI directly, I should use the values from Wilidata, so I'll list them as wd:Q854995, wd:Q37038, and wd:Q1286627.\n\nSince Wilidata doesn't use RDF type in the same way as DBpedia, I don't need to include a statement like ?uri a <http://www.wikidata.org/ontologies/core#Company>. Instead, I can directly query using the property P452 and the industry values.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should count distinct ?company where the industry is one of the three specified. So, I'll structure the query with a count of distinct ?company, filter where the industry is any of those three, using the 'IN' operator. Then, wrap it up in the correct SPARQL syntax, ensuring the prefixes are correctly referenced.\n</think>\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning for constructing the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n1. **Understand the Goal**: The query aims to retrieve all companies in the advertising industry from Wikidata.\n\n2. **Map DBpedia to Wikidata**:\n   - **Company**: DBpedia's `Company` maps to Wikidata's `Q4830453`.\n   - **Industry**: DBpedia's `industry` maps to Wikidata's `P452`.\n   - **Advertising**: DBpedia's `Advertising` maps to Wikidata's `Q854995`, `Q37038`, and `Q1286627`.\n\n3. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT ?company)` to count unique companies.\n   - Filter companies where the industry is any of the three Wikidata entities representing advertising.\n\n4. **SPARQL Syntax**:\n   - Use `PREFIX` to shorthand namespaces.\n   - Query structure: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ?company) WHERE { ?company p:P452 ?industry . FILTER (?industry = wd:Q854995 || ?industry = wd:Q37038 || ?industry = wd:Q1286627) }`.\n\nFinal SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?company) AS ?count)\nWHERE\n{\n  ?company p:P452 ?industry .\n  FILTER (?industry = wd:Q854995 || ?industry = wd:Q37038 || ?industry = wd:Q1286627)\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves and counts all companies in the advertising industry using Wikidata's entities and properties."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the provided DBpedia query. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the original query on DBpedia is asking for the university Angela Merkel attended. The query uses the almaMater property. I need to find the equivalent in Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, DBpedia's almaMater (dbo:almaMater) corresponds to Wikidata's P69. So, the property will change from dbo:almaMater to wdt:P69 in Wikidata.\n\nNext, the subject is Angela Merkel. In DBpedia, it's res:Angela_Merkel. In Wikidata, entities are usually prefixed with wd:, so it should be wd:Q567 based on the ER2 mapping provided.\n\nNow, constructing the SPARQL query. Wikidata usually uses the prefix wdt for property statements. So, the triple will be wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?university.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?university where Angela Merkel (wd:Q567) has the almaMater (wdt:P69) property.\n\nI should also include the necessary prefixes for Wikidata, which are typically wd: and wdt:. So, the prefixes section will define wd as <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and wdt as <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nFinally, wrapping it up, the SPARQL query will select distinct ?university to avoid duplicates and ensure we get the specific universities she attended.\n</think>\n\nLet me construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata) by following the information provided in the context and the ER2 mapping.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Relation in KG2 (Wikidata):**\n   - From the ER2 mapping:\n     - The DBpedia entity `res:Angela_Merkel` maps to `wikidata_id: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567`.\n     - The DBpedia relation `dbo:almaMater` maps to `wikidata_id: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P69`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query in Wikidata:**\n   - In Wikidata, entities are typically prefixed with `wd:`.\n   - Relations (properties) in Wikidata are prefixed with `wdt:` for direct property access.\n   - The property `P69` in Wikidata corresponds to \"alma mater\" (educational institution attended).\n\n3. **SPARQL Query Structure:**\n   - **PREFIXES:** Define the prefixes for Wikidata entities and properties.\n     - `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`\n     - `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>`\n   - **SELECT:** `?university` to retrieve the alma mater.\n   - **WHERE:** Define the triple pattern to query Angela Merkel's alma mater.\n     - `wd:Q567` (Angela Merkel)\n     - `wdt:P69` (alma mater property)\n     - `?university` (variable to bind the alma mater).\n\n4. **Final Query:**\n   Combining all the parts, the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata) is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?university\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?university\n}\n```\n\n**Complete SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?university\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?university\n}\n</sparql>\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the alma mater (university) of Angela Merkel from Wikidata.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find all the TV shows that Neil Patrick Harris has starred in. I'm a bit new to SPARQL, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in SPARQL, you're querying a knowledge graph. The structure is usually something like SELECT ?variable WHERE { ?variable a :Class; :property :value }. But I'm not entirely sure about the syntax in Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the context given, there's an entity and relation mapping that was used for DBpedia. So for TelevisionShow in DBpedia, the corresponding Wikidata ID is Q15416. For starring, it's P161, and Neil Patrick Harris is Q485310 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to select all entities that are instances of TelevisionShow, have the starring property, and the value is Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nIn SPARQL, I think it starts with PREFIX to define the namespaces, but I think in Wikidata, the common practice is to use the wdt: prefix for properties. So wdt:P161 would be the starring property.\n\nI should also make sure to include all necessary prefixes, like wd: for entities and wdt: for properties, and rdf: for RDF types.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, is it better to use rdfs:label for names? Or do I need to explicitly fetch the labels? Hmm, maybe I should limit it to just the URIs unless I need the names, which the user didn't specify.\n\nSo putting it together, I'd start with SELECT DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. Then, the variable, maybe ?tvShow, and the RDF type would be wd:Q15416 for TelevisionShow.\n\nThe property would be wdt:P161, and the object is wd:Q485310, which is Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if I need to include more, like rdf:type or if the structure is correct. Maybe I should look up a basic example of a Wikidata SPARQL query.\n\nOh right, the basic structure would have the subject, predicate, object. So ?tvShow wdt:P161 wd:Q485310. And also, to specify that ?tvShow is a TelevisionShow, so ?tvShow rdf:type wd:Q15416.\n\nWait, no, in Wikidata, the type is usually specified with the property wdt:P31, which is \"instance of\". So maybe it's better to use wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 instead of rdf:type.\n\nSo now, the WHERE clause would have two triple patterns: one for the type and one for starring. That would make sure we get only TV shows where he starred.\n\nPutting it all together, the query would look something like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?tvShow\nWHERE\n{\n  ?tvShow wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 .\n  ?tvShow wdt:P161 wd:Q485310 .\n}\n\nI think that's it. It selects distinct TV shows that are of type TelevisionShow and have Neil Patrick Harris as a starring actor. I hope I didn't miss any prefixes or syntax errors. Maybe I should test it on the Wikidata Query Service to make sure it works, but for now, this should be the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves all TV shows featuring Neil Patrick Harris, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Components**:\n   - **TelevisionShow**: Corresponds to Wikidata entity Q15416.\n   - **Starring**: Mapped to Wikidata property P161 (wdt:P161).\n   - **Neil Patrick Harris**: Identified as Q485310 in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the Query Structure**:\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate entries.\n   - Define the variable `?tvShow` to represent each TV show.\n   - Specify the class and property constraints in the WHERE clause using Wikidata's property prefixes (`wdt:`).\n\n3. **Formulate the Triple Patterns**:\n   - `{?tvShow wdt:P31 wd:Q15416}` ensures the subject is a TelevisionShow.\n   - `{?tvShow wdt:P161 wd:Q485310}` filters for shows starring Neil Patrick Harris.\n\n4. **Combine the Patterns**:\n   - Both conditions are linked with a period and enclosed in curly braces.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?tvShow\nWHERE\n{\n  ?tvShow wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 .\n  ?tvShow wdt:P161 wd:Q485310 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query fetches all distinct TV shows in Wikidata where Neil Patrick Harris is listed under the starring property."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out where JFK was assassinated. Let me start by understanding the problem. The original question is about the assassination location of JFK, and there's a similar SPARQL query provided for DBpedia. Now, I need to write a query for Wikidata using the same structure but with the right entities and properties.\n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query: it selects the URI where John F. Kennedy's deathPlace is. The query uses the specific resource and property from DBpedia. But in Wikidata, things are different because of their entity and property identifiers.\n\nFrom the context provided, there's an ER2 mapping that connects DBpedia resources to Wikidata entities. It shows that the DBpedia ID for JFK (http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy) maps to wikidata:Q9696. Similarly, the deathPlace property in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/deathPlace) maps to wikidata:P20, which I believe represents \"place of death\" in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the key here is to replace the DBpedia identifiers with their Wikidata counterparts. In Wikidata SPARQL, the prefix 'wd:' is commonly used for entities, and 'p:' for properties. Therefore, instead of using a full URL, I can use 'wd:Q9696' for JFK and 'p:P20' for the deathPlace property.\n\nNow, considering the structure of SPARQL queries, I'll need to select the distinct values to avoid duplicates. The variable for the place can be something like ?deathPlace, which will hold the URI of the location. Putting it all together, the query should look similar to the DBpedia one but with the Wikidata entities.\n\nI might also need to make sure that the syntax is correct. In Wikidata, the query might require prefixes to be declared, but often they're predefined. So, using 'wd:' and 'p:' should be sufficient without additional declarations.\n\nTo summarize, my steps are: \n1. Identify the Wikidata entity for JFK (Q9696).\n2. Identify the Wikidata property for deathPlace (P20).\n3. Structure the SPARQL query to select where JFK's deathPlace is.\n\nThat should give me the correct query to find the assassination location.\n</think>\n\nTo form the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we replace the DBpedia entities and properties with those from Wikidata. Using the ER2 mapping, we find JFK's entity as `wd:Q9696` and the deathPlace property as `p:P20`. The query selects the distinct URIs for the death place.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?deathPlace WHERE {\n    wd:Q9696 p:P20 ?deathPlace\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata that gives all swimmers born in Moscow, just like the example query does for DBpedia. Let me break this down step by step based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the original SPARQL query for DBpedia:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Swimmer> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow> }\n\nThis query selects all URIs where the resource is of type Swimmer and has a birthplace of Moscow.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query. From the Entity and Relation Mapping provided, I can see the corresponding Wikidata IDs:\n\n1. Swimmer in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q10843402.\n2. birthPlace in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P19.\n3. Moscow in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q649.\n\nSo, the general structure should be similar but using Wikidata's entities and properties. In Wikidata, the \"instance of\" property is P31. So, instead of using \"a\" as in DBpedia, I should use P31 to denote the type.\n\nNext, the property for birthplace is P19, and the value is Q649 for Moscow.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select distinct items where the item is an instance of Swimmer (P31:Q10843402) and has birthplace (P19) Moscow (Q649).\n\nI should also consider the prefixes to make the query more readable. Typically, in Wikidata, the prefix 'wd' is used for entities and 'p' for properties, but sometimes the full URIs are used. However, for clarity and to follow best practices, I'll include the prefixes.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user didn't specify prefixes, so to keep it simple, I'll just use the full URIs.\n\nSo, the WHERE clause would have two conditions: one for being a Swimmer and another for being born in Moscow.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10843402> .\n  ?item <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P19> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q649> .\n}\n\nI think that's correct. Each condition is connected with a semicolon to apply both to the same ?item. Using 'direct' in the property URIs is important to specify that we're using the direct statement.\n\nWait, does Wikidata require using 'direct' in the property paths, or is it optional? I believe 'direct' is used to specify that we're looking at direct claims without any qualifiers, so including it is good practice here.\n\nDouble-checking the mappings: Swimmer is Q10843402, P19 is birthplace, and Moscow is Q649. All correct.\n\nSo the final query should look like that.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map each component from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mappings:\n\n1. **Class**: Swimmer (DBpedia) \u2192 Q10843402 (Wikidata)\n2. **Property**: birthPlace (DBpedia) \u2192 P19 (Wikidata)\n3. **Value**: Moscow (DBpedia) \u2192 Q649 (Wikidata)\n\nIn Wikidata, we use the 'direct' keyword for direct property access. The SPARQL query retrieves all items that are instances of Swimmer and have Moscow as their birthplace.\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q10843402> .\n  ?item <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P19> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q649> .\n}\n</sparql>"

This mapping will help me translate the original SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the original query for DBpedia, it selects the URI of films where Alec Guinness starred, orders them by release date in descending order, and limits the result to one. So I need to replicate this logic in Wikidata.\n\nStarting with the prefixes, Wikidata uses WD and wdt for entities and properties, so I'll set those up. \n\nNow, breaking down the triple patterns:\n\n1. The main entity is the film, so in Wikidata, I'll use ?film instead of ?uri.\n2. The type is dbo:Film in DBpedia, which maps to wd:Q11424 in Wikidata. So I'll have ?film wdt:P31 wd:Q11424.\n3. The starring property is dbo:starring, which maps to P161. So ?film wdt:P161 wd:Q103894, since Alec Guinness's Wikidata ID is Q103894.\n4. The release date in DBpedia is dbo:releaseDate, which maps to P577. So I'll include ?film wdt:P577 ?releaseDate.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select ?film where these conditions are met, order by release date in descending order, and limit to one result.\n\nI should make sure the SPARQL syntax is correct, using the right prefixes and ensuring that the variables are properly used. I double-check the mappings to confirm that each DBpedia entity and property is correctly translated to Wikidata. \n\nSo the final query should effectively find the most recent film Alec Guinness starred in by querying Wikidata's data.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and properties used in the DBpedia query to their corresponding entities and properties in Wikidata. \n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **PREFIXES**:  \n   - `dbo` and `res` are used in DBpedia, but in Wikidata, we use `wd` and `p` for entities and properties, respectively. Specifically, `wd` denotes Wikidata entities, and `p` denotes property identifiers.\n\n2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?uri**:  \n   - In the DBpedia query, `?uri` is used to select the URI of the film. In Wikidata, we will use `?film` to denote the film entity.\n\n3. **?uri rdf:type dbo:Film**:  \n   - `rdf:type dbo:Film` in DBpedia is equivalent to `wdt:P31 wd:Q11424` in Wikidata. `P31` is the property for \"instance of,\" and `Q11424` is the Wikidata entity for \"film.\"\n\n4. **dbo:starring res:Alec_Guinness**:  \n   - `dbo:starring` in DBpedia is equivalent to `P161` in Wikidata, which represents \"cast member.\" `res:Alec_Guinness` is equivalent to `wd:Q103894` in Wikidata.\n\n5. **dbo:releaseDate ?date**:  \n   - `dbo:releaseDate` in DBpedia is equivalent to `P577` in Wikidata, which represents \"publication date.\" We'll use `?releaseDate` as the variable.\n\n6. **ORDER BY DESC(?date)**:  \n   - This part remains the same to order the results by the release date in descending order.\n\n7. **LIMIT 1**:  \n   - This part also remains the same to limit the results to the most recent film.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query for KG2 (Wikidata):\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film WHERE {\n  ?film wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n         wdt:P161 wd:Q103894 ;\n         wdt:P577 ?releaseDate .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?releaseDate)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>` and `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>` are used to define the prefixes for Wikidata entities and properties.\n- `SELECT DISTINCT ?film` selects the unique film entities.\n- `?film wdt:P31 wd:Q11424` asserts that the film is an instance of the \"film\" class.\n- `wdt:P161 wd:Q103894` indicates that Alec Guinness is a cast member of the film.\n- `wdt:P577 ?releaseDate` retrieves the release date of the film.\n- `ORDER BY DESC(?releaseDate)` orders the films by release date in descending order.\n- `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the most recent film is returned."

Let's start by understanding the original query. It selects the URI of a mountain, orders them by elevation in descending order, skips the first, and takes the next one, which gives the second highest.\n\nNow, looking at the entity and relation mapping. The DBpedia mountain class maps to Wikidata's Q8502, so in Wikidata, the mountain should be represented by wd:Q8502. The elevation property in DBpedia is P2044 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in the Wikidata SPARQL, I need to select the mountain entities with their elevations. I'll use 'a' to state that the entity is a mountain class, which is wd:Q8502. Then, I need to include a filter to ensure these are mountains on Earth, but I'm not sure how Earth is referenced. Maybe using aFTA (friendly name)? Or perhaps 'wd:Q2' since Earth is entity Q2 in Wikidata.\n\nWait, Earth in Wikidata is Q2. So I'll add '?mountain wdt:P495 \"Q2\".' to specify that the mountain is on Earth. The elevation property is P2044, so I'll use that to get the elevation values. \n\nNow, I need to order by elevation in descending order. After ordering, I want to skip the first and take the second, using OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the mountain and elevation, where the mountain is of type Q8502, on Earth (Q2), has elevation P2044, order those by elevation descending, and then offset and limit to get the second one.\n\nI should also test if 'wdt:P495' is the correct predicate for the country or location. I think 'P495' is 'country', but maybe mountains can be associated via different properties. Perhaps I should use a broader approach, but to keep it simple, I'll include it to filter only mountains on Earth.\n\nSo the final query should have all these elements to ensure it correctly retrieves the second highest mountain.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that identifies the second highest mountain on Earth, we need to consider the mappings provided between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and properties.\n\n1. **Identifying the Mountain Class**: In DBpedia, the mountain class is represented by `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Mountain`, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8502` in Wikidata. Thus, we will query for entities of type `wd:Q8502` (mountain).\n\n2. **Identifying the Elevation Property**: The elevation property in DBpedia is `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/elevation`, which maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2044` (elevation above sea level) in Wikidata. We will use this property to filter the elevation values of the mountains.\n\n3. **Constructing the Query**: We need to select entities (`?mountain`) that are instances of `wd:Q8502` and have an elevation value (`?elevation`). We will sort these entities by their elevation in descending order (`ORDER BY DESC(?elevation)`) and then skip the first result (`OFFSET 1`) to get the second highest mountain (`LIMIT 1`).\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query for KG2:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?mountain ?elevation\nWHERE\n{\n    ?mountain a wd:Q8502 ;\n        wdt:P2044 ?elevation ;\n        wdt:P495 \"Q2\".\n    }\nORDER BY DESC(?elevation)\nOFFSET 1\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query will retrieve the URI and elevation of the second highest mountain on Earth from the Wikidata knowledge graph."

I know that in DBpedia, the query uses dbo:populationTotal, but now I need to translate that into Wikidata's terms. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the mappings provided. The ER2 shows that the DBpedia resource for Cairo (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cairo) corresponds to two Wikidata entities: Q85 and Q20230483. I guess one might be for the city itself, and another could be a more specific version or maybe an alternative. For the population, DBpedia's populationTotal is mapped to Wikidata's P1082.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, entities are referred to by their Q numbers, like Q85. Properties are referred to by P numbers, like P1082. Instead of dbo:populationTotal, I'll use wdt:P1082 in the query. \n\nI remember that in SPARQL, you can use the prefix wd: for Wikidata entities, and wdt: for the properties. So I should start by defining the prefixes. The base might also be set to http://www.wikidata.org/. \n\nNow, to structure the query: I'll need to SELECT the population value, which in this case will be bound as ?pop. I need to specify the entity (Q85) and the property (P1082) to fetch the value. \n\nPutting it all together, the WHERE clause should have Q85 wdt:P1082 ?pop. I might also include any labels if needed, but since the question is just about the population, I can keep it simple.\n\nI should also consider if there are any qualifiers or additional constraints, but for total population, I think P1082 is sufficient. \n\nSo, the final query should define the prefixes, select the population, specify the entity and property, and that's it. I'll make sure to format it correctly, using the proper syntax and prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we analyze the ER2 mappings to find corresponding entities and properties.\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Properties**:\n   - Cairo in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q85 and Q20230483.\n   - Population in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P1082.\n\n2. **Construct the Query**:\n   - Use the Wikidata entity (Q85) and property (P1082).\n   - Utilize appropriate prefixes (wd: and wdt:) for Wikidata.\n\n3. **Final Query**:\nThe SPARQL query fetches the population of Cairo using Wikidata's entities and properties.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?pop WHERE {\n  wd:Q85 wdt:P1082 ?pop\n}\n</sparql>"

Let's start by understanding what the original query does.\n\nThe original query on DBpedia is asking for people who were born in Heraklion. It uses the ontology for Person and sets the birthPlace to Heraklion. The query is structured with prefixes for namespaces like yago, rdfs, rdf, and onto. It selects distinct uris where the type is onto:Person and the birthPlace is Heraklion.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that Dbpedia's Person maps to Wikidata's Q215627 and Q5. Hmm, Q5 is the main entity for human, so probably more relevant here. Then, birthPlace in Dbpedia maps to P19 in Wikidata. Heraklion in Dbpedia maps to Q160544 in Wikidata.\n\nNow, I need to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata. First, I should set up the prefixes for Wikidata, which would be something like wd and wdt for the entity and property namespaces. \n\nThe structure should be similar: select distinct the entity where it's of type person, and has birth place Heraklion. In Wikidata, this translates to using wd:Q5 for Person, wdt:P19 for birthPlace, and wd:Q160544 for Heraklion.\n\nI should make sure to escape any URIs in case they have special characters, but I think in this case they don't. Also, the SELECT DISTINCT is important to avoid duplicate entries.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query for Wikidata should select all ?person such that they are of type wd:Q5 and have wdt:P19 equal to wd:Q160544.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's look at the process used to construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata).\n\n1. **Identify the Person Entity**: The ER2 mapping indicates that `dbpedia:Person` maps to `wikidata:Q215627` and `wikidata:Q5`. Since `Q5` is the primary entity for a person, we'll use `wd:Q5`.\n\n2. **Identify the Birthplace Property**: The property `dbpedia:birthPlace` maps to `wikidata:P19`, so we'll use `wdt:P19`.\n\n3. **Identify Heraklion Entity**: The ER2 mapping shows that `dbpedia:Heraklion` maps to `wikidata:Q160544`, so we'll use `wd:Q160544`.\n\nThe SPARQL query will select all entities that are of type person (`wd:Q5`) and have their birthplace (`wdt:P19`) as Heraklion (`wd:Q160544`).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query for KG2 (Wikidata):**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?person \nWHERE \n{\n  ?person wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .\n  ?person wdt:P19 wd:Q160544 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all individuals (`?person`) who are classified as humans (`wd:Q5`) and were born in Heraklion (`wd:Q160544`)."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find out how many children Benjamin Franklin had. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I have the information from the previous query on DBpedia. The user provided details about how to construct the SPARQL query for DBpedia, which includes prefixes, selecting a count of distinct URIs where the relation 'dbo:child' is present for Benjamin Franklin.\n\nNow, I need to translate that into a Wikidata query. From the ER2 mapping provided, I know that Benjamin Franklin's DBpedia ID is mapped to Wikidata's Q34969. So instead of 'res:Benjamin_Franklin' from DBpedia, in Wikidata I'll use 'wd:Q34969'.\n\nNext, the 'dbo:child' property in DBpedia corresponds to 'P40' in Wikidata, which is 'child'. So in Wikidata, the property will be 'wdt:P40' for the direct claims or 'p:P40' along with 'ps:' for qualifiers if needed, but since we're just counting children, I think 'wdt:P40' should suffice.\n\nPutting this together, the structure of the SPARQL query should be similar to the DBpedia one but with Wikidata's prefixes and URIs. I'll need to define the prefixes for 'wd' and 'wdt'. Then, select the count of distinct URIs where Benjamin Franklin (wd:Q34969) has the property P40, pointing to each child's URI.\n\nI also need to make sure to count each child only once, hence using COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri). The WHERE clause will structure the triples, ensuring that each ?uri is a child of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nLet me double-check the syntax. The prefixes should be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nThen, the SELECT part remains the same, counting the distinct URIs. The WHERE clause will specify that wd:Q34969 is connected via wdt:P40 to ?uri.\n\nSo putting it all together, the query should accurately fetch the number of children Benjamin Franklin had according to Wikidata. I think that's it!\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we first identify the corresponding entities and properties from the ER2 mapping. Benjamin Franklin's Wikidata ID is Q34969, and the 'child' relation is P40.\n\nUsing these, we formulate the query by selecting the count of distinct URIs linked to Franklin via P40.\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri) AS ?count) \nWHERE {\n    wd:Q34969 wdt:P40 ?uri .\n}\n```"

The user initially provided a DBpedia SPARQL query, but now they want me to do the same for Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the existing ER2 mapping. It shows that \"D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport\" in DBpedia maps to \"Q58226\" in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, the airport is identified by this Q-code. \n\nNext, the elevation property in DBpedia is \"dbo:elevation\", which maps to \"P2044\" in Wikidata. I should use this P2044 to get the elevation in the Wikidata query.\n\nNow, in SPARQL, Wikidata uses the \"wd:\" prefix for entities and \"p:\" or \"wdt:\" for properties. I'll use \"wdt:P2044\" to access the elevation property. The entity is \"wd:Q58226\".\n\nI need to construct the query. It should select the elevation (?elevation) where the entity (wd:Q58226) has the property wdt:P2044 with the value ?elevation. Since we just need one result, I'll add \"LIMIT 1\".\n\nI should also set the prefix for better readability. The standard prefixes in Wikidata are \"wd\" and \"wdt\", so I'll include those.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will start with the prefix declarations, then the SELECT statement, followed by the WHERE clause with the entity and its property, and finally the LIMIT.\n\nLet me write it out step by step to make sure I don't miss anything. Double-checking the mappings to ensure I have the correct Q and P codes. Everything seems to align, so this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for the Wikidata knowledge graph (KG2) that retrieves the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Wikidata entity for D\u00fcsseldorf Airport**: The Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2) tells us that D\u00fcsseldorf Airport in DBpedia (`dbr:D\u00fcsseldorf_Airport`) maps to the Wikidata entity `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58226`.\n\n2. **Identify the Wikidata property for elevation**: The ER2 also tells us that the DBpedia property `dbo:elevation` maps to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2044`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**: Using the Wikidata entity and property, we can construct a SPARQL query to retrieve the elevation of D\u00fcsseldorf Airport.\n\nHere is the reasoning for each part of the query:\n- `PREFIX wikidata: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`: This defines the prefix for Wikidata entities and properties.\n- `SELECT ?elevation`: This specifies that we want to retrieve the elevation value.\n- `WHERE { wikidata:Q58226 wikidata:P2044 ?elevation }`: This triple pattern retrieves the elevation (`?elevation`) of the Wikidata entity `Q58226` (D\u00fcsseldorf Airport).\n- `LIMIT 1`: This limits the result to a single value, as we only need the elevation of one airport.\n\nFinal SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wikidata: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?elevation WHERE { wikidata:Q58226 wikidata:P2044 ?elevation } LIMIT 1\n```"

Let's start by looking at the information provided.\n\nFrom the context, I see that there's an existing SPARQL query for DBpedia (KG1) which retrieves the country of Mecca. The query uses the prefix dbo for the ontology and res for the resource. It selects the URI where Mecca is related to the country property.\n\nNow, I need to map this to Wikidata. The Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2) provides the necessary links between DBpedia and Wikidata IDs. \n\nFirst, Mecca in DBpedia is at http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mecca, which maps to Wikidata's Q5806. So, in Wikidata, Mecca will be represented by the URI http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5806.\n\nNext, the relation dbo:country in DBpedia corresponds to P17 in Wikidata. In Wikidata's terminology, properties like country are represented with P followed by a number, so P17 stands for \"country\".\n\nIn Wikidata, the query structure is a bit different from DBpedia. Instead of using a prefix for the ontology, properties in Wikidata are accessed directly with their P numbers, and the actual values (like the country) are stored as objects.\n\nSo, to construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, I'll need to select the country value where Mecca (Q5806) has the P17 property. The variable I'm selecting here is the country URI, which I'll call ?country.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will start with the PREFIX for the entity, which is wdt: for properties and wd: for the entity ID. Then, I'll write the SELECT statement to get the distinct ?country URI. The WHERE clause will specify that Mecca's country is the property we're looking for.\n\nThe final query should look something like PREFIXing the necessary namespaces, selecting the ?country variable, and ensuring that the WHERE clause links Mecca to its country via P17.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that returns all holidays celebrated around the world, similar to what the DBpedia query does. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I look at the DBpedia query. It uses the dbo:Holiday ontology and selects resources of type rdf:type dbo:Holiday. So, in Wikidata, I need to find the equivalent of \"Holiday.\" \n\nFrom the ER2 mapping, I see that DBpedia's Holiday corresponds to Wikidata's Q1445650. So, in Wikidata, I should query for instances of Q1445650.\n\nWikidata's ontology uses different prefixes. Instead of dbo:, it uses wdt: for properties. So, I'll use wdt:P31 to denote \"instance of.\" The RDF type in SPARQL is usually handled with a type property, but in Wikidata, it's more about using wdt:P31.\n\nAdditionally, to get a unique list, I should use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates. So, the query should SELECT DISTINCT ?uri. \n\nPutting it together, the query will ask for all ?uri that are instances of wdt:Q1445650. The structure would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n...\n?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in SPARQL, the property for \"instance of\" is usually P31, and the value is the Wikidata item Q1445650. So actually, it should be ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650.\n\nSo, the prefixes are important. I need to include both wdt and wd. Wdt is for direct properties, and wd is for the items themselves.\n\nLet me make sure. The full query would be:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650\n}\n\nWait, but in some cases, people also include rdf:type, but in Wikidata, using P31 is more appropriate because that's how they define instance relationships.\n\nSo, that should correctly fetch all holidays in Wikidata. I think that's it. Let me double-check the syntax. Yep, that looks right. It selects distinct URIs where each URI is an instance of Q1445650, which is \"holiday.\"\n</think>\n\nHere's the reasoning and the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2):\n\nThe goal is to retrieve all holidays celebrated globally from Wikidata. Since the DBpedia query fetches instances of \"Holiday\" using `dbo:Holiday`, I map this to Wikidata's equivalent, which is Q1445650. In Wikidata, `wdt:P31` denotes \"instance of,\" so the query uses this property. \n\nThe final SPARQL query is crafted to select distinct URIs of entities that are instances of Q1445650.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650\n}\n</sparql>"

I remember that in the previous example, they used DBpedia, but now we're moving to Wikidata. Let me start by understanding what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need to find the correct entities and properties in Wikidata. From the ER2 mapping, I see that Lou Reed in DBpedia is mapped to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189080\" in Wikidata. So, I'll use that as the subject in my query.\n\nNext, the genre in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P136, which stands for \"genre\". So, the property I need is \"wdt:P136\". Wait, I remember that in Wikidata, the property is prefixed with 'wdt:', so I should make sure to use that.\n\nNow, I need to construct the SPARQL query. The basic structure is SELECT followed by the variables I want to retrieve. In this case, I want the genre URIs. So, I'll use SELECT DISTINCT ?uri to get unique results.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the genre URIs where Lou Reed is the subject and genre is the predicate. So, the triple would be <Q189080> wdt:P136 ?uri. I should also make sure to specify the correct endpoint, which for Wikidata is <https://query.wikidata.org/sparql>.\n\nI should also check the syntax. SPARQL uses curly braces for the WHERE clause. Let me make sure that's correct. Wait, the example didn't include the endpoint in the query, but I think it's good practice to include it just in case. So, I'll add that at the beginning.\n\nPutting it all together, the query will look something like this: SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189080> wdt:P136 ?uri }. Wait, no, I think in SPARQL, the endpoint is specified with a PREFIX or via the FROM clause. But maybe it's better to just write the WHERE clause with the full URI for Lou Reed.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the prefix 'wd:' for the entity and 'p:' for the property, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Wikidata typically uses 'wd:' for entities and 'wdt:' for properties. So, maybe I can write it as wd:Q189080 wdt:P136 ?uri. That would make the query cleaner.\n\nSo, the final query would be SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q189080 wdt:P136 ?uri }. Let me double-check that. Yes, that should work because 'wd:Q189080' refers to Lou Reed and 'wdt:P136' is the genre property.\n\nI should test if this query returns the expected genres like rock, proto-punk, etc. Maybe I can also use a tool to run this query, but since I'm just writing it out, I think this is correct.\n\nI should also explain why this works: by using the correct Wikidata entity and property, the query fetches all genres associated with Lou Reed. Using SELECT DISTINCT ensures we don't get duplicate entries.\n\nSo, to summarize: I identified the correct Wikidata entity and property, constructed the SPARQL query using them, and made sure the syntax was correct.\n</think>\n\nTo produce a SPARQL query for Wikidata that retrieves the genres of music Lou Reed played, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Property in Wikidata:**\n   - Lou Reed's Wikidata entity is `Q189080`.\n   - The property for genre in Wikidata is `P136`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri` to fetch unique genre URIs.\n   - Use the subject `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189080>` (or `wd:Q189080` for short) and the predicate `wdt:P136`.\n\n3. **Query Syntax:**\n   - Ensure the query is syntactically correct with the WHERE clause containing the triple pattern.\n\nThe final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q189080 wdt:P136 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all genres associated with Lou Reed from Wikidata."

I know that in the previous example, the user used DBpedia, so I need to adjust that to work with Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of Wikidata. From what I remember, Wikidata uses different prefixes and namespaces compared to DBpedia. In the ER2 mapping provided, I see that Frank Sinatra's DBpedia ID is linked to Q40912 in Wikidata, and the birthPlace property is linked to P19. So, I should use these identifiers in my query.\n\nI'm a bit fuzzy on the exact syntax of SPARQL for Wikidata. I think Wikidata's entities are typically referenced with their Q numbers, like wd:Q40912, and properties with their P numbers, like p:P19. But I'm not entirely sure if these are the correct prefixes. Maybe I should check if there's a specific prefix like 'wd' or 'wdt' used in Wikidata.\n\nWait, I think in Wikidata, 'p' and 'ps' prefixes are used for properties and their statements. So, 'p:P19' would refer to the birthPlace property, and 'ps:P19' would link to the actual value. That makes sense because properties in Wikidata are further divided into statements and their values.\n\nSo, putting that together, the structure would be to select the birthplace where Frank Sinatra (Q40912) has the P19 property. The query should return the value of that property.\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes at the beginning of the query. So, I'll include 'PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>' to directly access the property values without needing 'p' or 'ps'. That might simplify the query.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use 'wdt:P19' to directly get the birthplace without having to use 'ps'. That would make the query cleaner. So, the WHERE clause would link Frank Sinatra's entity to wdt:P19 and bind it to ?place.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start with the PREFIX declarations for 'wd' and 'wdt', then structure the query to select ?place where Frank Sinatra has the P19 property.\n\nI think that's it. I'll write the query with these considerations in mind and make sure it's properly formatted.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to those in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Entity and Relation in Wikidata:**\n   - The entity \"Frank_Sinatra\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"Q40912\" in Wikidata.\n   - The relation \"birthPlace\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"P19\" in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata prefix `wd` for entities and `p` or `ps` for properties.\n   - The query selects the birthplace (`?place`) where Frank Sinatra (`Q40912`) has the property `P19`.\n\nFinal SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?place \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q40912 wdt:P19 ?place\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nThe user initially provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia (KG1) that finds the city with the least inhabitants. They want to replicate this for Wikidata. The ER2 mapping gives correspondences between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and properties.\n\nFirst, let's break down the original KG1 query. It uses dbo:City and dbo:populationTotal. From ER2, I know that dbo:City corresponds to Wikidata's Q515, and populationTotal corresponds to P1082.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the class for cities is Q515, and the property for population is P1082.\n\nNow, I need to construct a SPARQL query that selects cities with their population and orders them from smallest to largest, limiting the result to one.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the prefix wd: is used for entities, and p: or ps: for properties. But since we're using the latest SPARQL, wdt:P1082 is the correct syntax for the property.\n\nThe query structure should be:\n1. PREFIXES: Define the necessary prefixes like wd and wdt.\n2. SELECT: Select the city's URI and population.\n3. WHERE: Filter for entities of type city (wd:Q515) and with a population (wdt:P1082).\n4. ORDER BY: Sort by population in ascending order.\n5. LIMIT: Return only the smallest one.\n\nI should also include distinct to avoid duplicate entries, but in Wikidata, each entity is unique, so maybe it's optional. But to be safe, I'll include it.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look something like:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?city ?population WHERE { ?city wdt:P31 wd:Q515; wdt:P1082 ?population. } ORDER BY ?population ASC LIMIT 1\n\nWait, I should double-check if wdt:P31 is the correct property for \"instance of\". Sometimes it's wdt:P31, but I'm pretty sure that's right. P31 is \"instance of\", so using it with wd:Q515 will correctly identify cities.\n\nYes, that should work. Now, I'll structure it step-by-step as per the user's instruction, then provide the final query tag.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entities and Relations**:\n   - From the ER2 mapping:\n     - `dbo:City` maps to `wd:Q515` (city).\n     - `dbo:populationTotal` maps to `wdt:P1082` (population).\n\n2. **Formulate SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use the corridponding Wikidata entities and properties.\n   - Select the city URI and population.\n   - Filter entities of type `Q515` (city) with a population property `P1082`.\n   - Order results by population in ascending order.\n   - Limit results to the smallest population.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n- **PREFIX**: Use `wd` and `wdt` for Wikidata entities and properties.\n- **SELECT DISTINCT**: Retrieve unique city URIs and their population values.\n- **WHERE**: Filter for entities that are cities (`wd:Q515`) and have a population (`wdt:P1082`).\n- **ORDER BY**: Sort results by population in ascending order.\n- **LIMIT 1**: Return the city with the smallest population.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?city ?population WHERE {\n  ?city wdt:P31 wd:Q515;\n    wdt:P1082 ?population.\n}\nORDER BY ?population ASC\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find television shows created by Walt Disney. \n\nFirst, I remember that in KG1 (DBpedia), the query used 'dbo:TelevisionShow' for the type and 'dbo:creator' to link to Walt Disney. Now, I have to map these to Wikidata entities.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, 'dbo:TelevisionShow' corresponds to 'Q15416' in Wikidata. So, I'll use 'wd:Q15416' for the type.\n\nNext, the 'creator' property 'dbo:creator' maps to 'P170' in Wikidata, which is 'creator' as well. So, the predicate will be 'wdt:P170'.\n\nFor Walt Disney himself, 'res:Walt_Disney' maps to 'Q8704', so I'll use 'wd:Q8704' as the object.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select distinct URIs where each URI is of type television show and has Walt Disney as the creator. I'll use the appropriate prefixes for Wikidata, which are 'wd' and 'wds' for the datatype and object properties respectively.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct, so I'll write out each part carefully. I'll also include a comment to explain what the query does, even though it's optional.\n\nFinally, I'll test the query structure in my mind to ensure it logically fetches the desired results without errors. Once satisfied, I'll present the final query enclosed within the specified tags.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the concepts from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the type of entity**: In DBpedia, the type is `dbo:TelevisionShow`, which maps to `wikidata:Q15416` in Wikidata.\n2. **Identify the property for the creator**: In DBpedia, the property is `dbo:creator`, which maps to `wikidata:P170` in Wikidata.\n3. **Identify the creator entity**: In DBpedia, the creator is `res:Walt_Disney`, which maps to `wikidata:Q8704` in Wikidata.\n\nUsing these mappings, we can construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q15416 ;  # Statement for type: Television Show\n    wdt:P170 wd:Q8704     # Statement for creator: Walt Disney\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all unique URIs (`?uri`) of television shows created by Walt Disney in Wikidata.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**:\n1. **Prefix Definitions**: The query starts by defining the necessary prefixes for Wikidata (`wdt`, `wd`, and `xsd`).\n2. **SELECT DISTINCT ?uri**: This specifies that we want to retrieve distinct URIs of entities.\n3. **WHERE Clause**: The WHERE clause contains the conditions for filtering the data.\n   - `?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q15416`: This line states that we are looking for entities (`?uri`) that are of type \"television show\" (Q15416).\n   - `wdt:P170 wd:Q8704`: This line filters for entities where the creator (P170) is Walt Disney (Q8704).\n\nThe SPARQL query above will return all television shows created by Walt Disney according to the Wikidata knowledge graph."

        },
        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so the user has asked for a SPARQL query to retrieve all Swedish holidays using Wikidata as the knowledge graph. Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the previous example, the user provided a query for DBpedia, and now they're asking for Wikidata. From the provided ER2 mapping, I can see how the entities and properties from DBpedia correspond to those in Wikidata.\n\nThe original query was selecting URIs where the subject is a Holiday and is related to Sweden. In DBpedia, the ontology is straightforward with <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Holiday> and <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>. Now, I need to map these to their Wikidata equivalents.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, the Holiday concept in DBpedia maps to \"Q1445650\" in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, I should use \"wd:Q1445650\" as the class for the holiday entities.\n\nNext, the 'country' property in DBpedia is mapped to \"P17\" in Wikidata. So, the predicate I'll use is \"p:P17\". That makes sense because \"p:P17\" stands for 'country' in Wikidata.\n\nThen, the object of that triple should be Sweden. In DBpedia, it's \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden\", which maps to both \"Q34\" and \"Q272930\" in Wikidata. I think \"Q34\" is the main entity for Sweden, so using \"wd:Q34\" should suffice.\n\nNow, constructing the query. In SPARQL for Wikidata, we typically use the prefix 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for properties. So, the query will select all distinct items where the item is an instance of Q1445650 and has the country P17 set to Q34.\n\nI should make sure to use the correct prefixes, though sometimes 'wdt:' is used for direct properties. Wait, actually, for qualifiers in triples, 'p:' is for the property, and then 'ps:' for the value, but in this case, since we're just checking if the country is Sweden without any qualifiers, I can use 'wdt:P17' for the direct property.\n\nWait, no, in the example provided earlier by the assistant, the query used 'p:P17' and then 'ps:*' for the actual value. Let me think again. In Wikidata, the SNORKEL approach requires using 'p:P17' to get the statement, and then using 'ps:P17' to get the value. So, the triple would be ?item p:P17 ?statement, and then ?statement ps:P17 wd:Q34.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the query should select all distinct items where they are of class Q1445650 and have a country statement pointing to Q34. That should return all Swedish holidays.\n\nI should also include a prefix for 'wikibase' to make the query more readable, but sometimes it's optional depending on the endpoint.\n\nAlright, so the query would look like selecting distinct items where ?item is a holiday (using wdt:P31?), wait, no. Wait, in Wikidata, 'instance of' is P31. So, I should use 'wdt:P31' to say that ?item is an instance of Q1445650.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the ER2 mapping shows that the DBpedia Holiday maps to Q1445650, which is the ID for 'holiday'. So, perhaps the correct way is to say that ?item is an instance of Q1445650. So, using wdt:P31 for 'instance of'.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm conflating things. Let me make sure: in the ER2 mapping, the DBpedia class is Holiday, which maps to Q1445650 in Wikidata. So, in Wikidata, the item's 'instance of' property (P31) should be Q1445650. So the correct triple is ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650.\n\nBut wait, in the ER2 mapping provided earlier, it maps to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1445650\", which is the entity for 'holiday'. So yes, that should be used with wdt:P31.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me step back. The original query in DBpedia was selecting URIs where the subject is a type of Holiday and has country Sweden. In Wikidata, the structure is that the item's type (P31) is the holiday class, and it has a country property (P17) pointing to Sweden (Q34).\n\nSo, the correct query is to select ?item where ?item has type wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650, and ?item has wdt:P17 wd:Q34.\n\nBut in the ER2 mapping, it also shows that Sweden can be Q272930, but I think Q34 is the main one, so just using Q34 is enough.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650 ;\n         wdt:P17 wd:Q34 .\n}\n\nAlternatively, since sometimes 'wdt' is not a standard prefix and might require using 'p' and 'ps', but I think 'wdt' is more straightforward and commonly used.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check: in Wikidata SPARQL, 'wdt' is a prefix that refers to direct property values, while 'p' and 'ps' are for accessing qualifiers.\n\nIn this case, I just need the direct property value, so using 'wdt:P17' should suffice.\n\nSo, the final query would be selecting distinct ?item where ?item is a holiday and its country is Sweden.\n\nAlright, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata) that retrieves all Swedish holidays, we need to:\n\n1. **Map the concepts from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided mapping**:\n   - The DBpedia class `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Holiday>` maps to the Wikidata entity `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1445650>` (Holiday).\n   - The DBpedia property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>` maps to the Wikidata property `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17>` (country).\n   - The DBpedia resource `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden>` maps to the Wikidata entity `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34>` (Sweden).\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL query using the mapped entities and properties**:\n   - Use theWikidata entity `wd:Q1445650` to identify holidays.\n   - Use the Wikidata property `wdt:P17` to specify the country.\n   - Use the Wikidata entity `wd:Q34` to represent Sweden.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650 ;\n         wdt:P17 wd:Q34 .\n}\n```\n\n</sparql>"

So, in Wikidata, the entity is represented by `Q312` and the property is `P2295`.\n\nIn Wikidata, to get the value of a property, you typically use the `wdt:` prefix for the claim, and `ps:` for the property itself if you're using a more specific syntax. But for a simple query, using `wdt:P2295` directly is straightforward.\n\nSo, the subject of the query will be `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312>`, the predicate will be `wdt:P2295`, and the variable will be `?ni`.

Let me go through the information step by step to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, there's a natural language question: \"Where did Abraham Lincoln die?\" The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia, so now I need to create a similar query for Wikidata. I also see that there's an entity and relation mapping provided, which connects DBpedia IDs to Wikidata IDs.\n\nLooking at the DBpedia query, it uses `dbo:deathPlace` to get the death place of Abraham Lincoln. The PREFIXes are set up with `dbo`, `res`, and `rdfs`. I need to map these to Wikidata's structure. \n\nIn DBpedia, the resource for Abraham Lincoln is `res:Abraham_Lincoln`, and the property is `dbo:deathPlace`. From the ER mapping, I see that `res:Abraham_Lincoln` corresponds to `Q91` in Wikidata. The property `dbo:deathPlace` corresponds to `P20` in Wikidata. So, I'll need to use `wd:Q91` for Lincoln and `p:P20` for the death place.\n\nNow, thinking about the structure of SPARQL queries in Wikidata. Typically, you select the variable you're interested in, which in this case is the death place. So I'll use `SELECT ?deathPlace` to get the value. \n\nNext, I'll specify the triple that connects Lincoln to his death place. That would be `wd:Q91 p:P20 ?deathPlace`. Wait, in Wikidata, properties often have a qualifier, so maybe it's better to use `ps:P20` for the main statement. So the triple becomes `wd:Q91 ps:P20 ?deathPlace`.\n\nPrefixes are important to make the query readable. So I should include the standard Wikidata prefixes: `wd` for entities and `ps` for property statements. These are usually predefined, but including them makes it explicit.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select `?deathPlace` where `wd:Q91` has `ps:P20` as `?deathPlace`. That should give me the death place of Abraham Lincoln according to Wikidata.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other considerations, like whether `p:P20` should be used instead of `ps:P20`. But I think `ps:` is correct for the main statement, while `p:` is for qualifiers, which aren't needed here because we just want the value.\n\nAlso, since the user didn't specify any additional conditions, this query should suffice. It's straightforward and answers the question posed without unnecessary complexity.\n\nSo, the final query should look something like selecting `?deathPlace` where `wd:Q91` has `ps:P20` as `?deathPlace`, with the appropriate prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping. Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Mapping Abraham Lincoln**:  \n   In DBpedia, Abraham Lincoln is represented as `res:Abraham_Lincoln`. From the ER2 mapping, the corresponding Wikidata ID is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q91`, which is typically represented in SPARQL as `wd:Q91`.\n\n2. **Mapping Death Place**:  \n   The property `dbo:deathPlace` in DBpedia corresponds to `P20` in Wikidata. In Wikidata, properties are represented using the `p:` prefix or `ps:` for direct property statements. For simplicity, we will use `p:P20` in the query.\n\n3. **Constructing the SPARQL Query**:  \n   The goal is to retrieve the death place of Abraham Lincoln from Wikidata. Therefore, we need to query for the object (`?deathPlace`) associated with the property `P20` (death place) for the entity `Q91` (Abraham Lincoln).\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?deathPlace\nWHERE {\n    wd:Q91 wdt:P20 ?deathPlace.\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the death place of Abraham Lincoln from Wikidata. The `wdt:P20` is used to directly access the death place property, and `wd:Q91` refers to Abraham Lincoln in Wikidata."

The key mappings are:\n- Himalayas in DBpedia correspond to three Wikidata entities: Q105981852, Q26235529, Q5451.\n- The 'country' property in DBpedia maps to P17 in Wikidata.\n- The 'capital' property in DBpedia maps to P36 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query. First, identify all entities representing the Himalayas in Wikidata. Then, find the countries associated with them using P17. From those countries, extract their capitals using P36.\n\nIn SPARQL, I can use the VALUES clause to list all the Himalayas entities. Then, use a property path or filter to get the countries. Since Wikidata uses P17 for 'country' and P36 for 'capital', I'll structure the query to select the capitals.\n\nI should also make sure to select distinct values to avoid duplicates. So, the query structure will start with SELECT DISTINCT, then the variable for the capital. The WHERE clause will include the VALUES for the Himalayas, followed by the country and capital properties.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look like selecting the capital, setting the Himalayas entities, linking each to a country, and then getting the capital from the country.\n\nI need to format this correctly in SPARQL syntax, ensuring that the prefixes are correct and the variables are properly used. Testing the query in Wikidata's query service would be a good idea to confirm it works and returns the expected capitals.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding Wikidata equivalents using the provided ER mapping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Entity**:\n   - The main entity in this query is \"Himalayas,\" which is represented in DBpedia as `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas>`.\n   - From the ER mapping, the corresponding Wikidata entities for \"Himalayas\" are:\n     - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105981852`\n     - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26235529`\n     - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5451`\n\n2. **Identify the Property for Country**:\n   - In DBpedia, the property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>` is used to link the Himalayas to the countries they pass through.\n   - From the ER mapping, the corresponding Wikidata property is `P17` (country).\n\n3. **Identify the Property for Capital**:\n   - In DBpedia, the property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital>` is used to link a country to its capital.\n   - From the ER mapping, the corresponding Wikidata property is `P36` (capital).\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use the `VALUES` clause to specify the Wikidata entities for the Himalayas.\n   - Use the `wdt:` prefix for Wikidata property paths.\n   - Use `[]` to represent a blank node for the country.\n   - Select the capital (`?capital`) and filter for distinct values to avoid duplicates.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital WHERE {\n  VALUES ?himalayas { wd:Q105981852 wd:Q26235529 wd:Q5451 }\n  ?himalayas wdt:P17 [] .\n  [] wdt:P36 ?capital .\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `SELECT DISTINCT ?capital`: This selects the distinct capitals of the countries.\n- `VALUES ?himalayas { wd:Q105981852 wd:Q26235529 wd:Q5451 }`: This specifies the Wikidata entities corresponding to the Himalayas.\n- `?himalayas wdt:P17 []`: This finds the countries associated with the Himalayas (using `P17` for \"country\").\n- `[] wdt:P36 ?capital`: This finds the capitals of those countries (using `P36` for \"capital\")."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the country where Limerick Lake is located, but this time using the Wikidata knowledge graph instead of DBpedia. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the previous example, the user used DBpedia with its own prefixes and query structure. Now, I have to switch to Wikidata, which uses a different set of prefixes and property identifiers. \n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided earlier, I see that the DBpedia resource for Limerick Lake is mapped to Wikidata's Q6386177. So, instead of using res:Limerick_Lake, I'll need to use the Wikidata identifier, which is wd:Q6386177. Also, the property for country in DBpedia (dbo:country) corresponds to Wikidata's P17. So in SPARQL, I should use p:P17.\n\nI also recall that in Wikidata, the actual values are stored under specific URLs, so I should use the prefix wdt:P17 for the property to get the triples, and psv: for the property value.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure of the SPARQL query should start with the prefixes. Then, in the WHERE clause, I select the variable for the country and filter the results to ensure I only get distinct values. So, I'll construct the query using the wd:Q6386177 entity and the wdt:P17 property.\n\nI should make sure to include all the necessary prefixes for Wikidata, such as wd, wdt, and psv. Once the query is built, I'll format it correctly within the SPARQL tags as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding IDs in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping. Here\u2019s how we build the query step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Resource (Entity):**\n   - The DBpedia resource for \"Limerick Lake\" is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Limerick_Lake`.\n   - From ER2, this maps to the Wikidata entity `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6386177`, which we can abbreviate as `wd:Q6386177`.\n\n2. **Identify the Property (Relation):**\n   - The DBpedia property for \"country\" is `http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country`.\n   - From ER2, this maps to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P17`, which we can abbreviate as `p:P17`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - We use the `PREFIX` declarations for Wikidata:\n     - `wd` for entity IDs: `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`\n     - `p` for property IDs: `PREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>`\n   - We select the distinct country (`?country`).\n   - We filter the results to ensure we only get distinct values.\n   - In the `WHERE` clause, we specify that `wd:Q6386177` (Limerick Lake) should have the property `p:P17` (country) with the value `?country`.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX psv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nPREFIX\tps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE {\n  wd:Q6386177 wdt:P17 ?country.\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know the user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia. The query uses the dbo:height property. From the ER2 mapping, I see that dbo:height in DBpedia corresponds to P2048 in Wikidata. So, I need to use P2048 in my Wikidata query.\n\nNext, the entity for Michael Jordan in DBpedia is res:Michael_Jordan. The ER2 mapping shows that this maps to Q41421 in Wikidata. So, I'll use Q41421 as the entity in the Wikidata query.\n\nNow, the structure of a SPARQL query in Wikidata typically uses the prefix wdt: for properties and wd: for entities. So, I'll need to include PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> at the beginning of the query.\n\nThe SELECT clause is the same as the DBpedia query; I want to select the height value, which is ?num. So, SELECT DISTINCT ?num.\n\nIn the WHERE clause, I'll specify the entity and the property. That gives me <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41421> wdt:P2048 ?num. \n\nPutting it all together, I structure the query with the prefixes first, then the SELECT and WHERE clauses as I thought. I'll make sure to format it correctly with the necessary semicolons after the prefixes and proper indentation.\n\nI should double-check the prefixes to make sure they're correct. WD properties use wdt:, and entities use wd:. The entity for Michael Jordan is Q41421, so wd:Q41421 is correct. P2048 is the right property for height, so wdt:P2048 is accurate.\n\nI think that covers everything. Let me write out the complete query to ensure it all fits together properly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to identify the corresponding entities and properties from the provided mapping.\n\n1. ** Wikidata Entity**: The entity for Michael Jordan (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Jordan) in Wikidata is Q41421 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41421).\n\n2. ** Wikidata Property**: The property for height (dbo:height) in DBpedia maps to P2048 (http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P2048) in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Namespaces**: In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with `wd:` and properties with `wdt:`.\n\nPutting these together, the SPARQL query retrieves the height of Michael Jordan using Q41421 and P2048.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?num\nWHERE {\n    wd:Q41421 wdt:P2048 ?num\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given context. The original question is about finding films that Clint Eastwood both directed and starred in. The user provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia and now wants the equivalent for Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of the original query. It uses DBpedia's ontology to find URIs where Clint Eastwood is both the director and a starring actor. The query structure is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood> }\n\nNow, I have to map this to Wikidata. The ER2 mapping shows that the director property in DBpedia (dbpedia_id: director) corresponds to Wikidata's P57, and the starring property (dbpedia_id: starring) corresponds to P161. Clint Eastwood in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q43203.\n\nSo, I need to construct a SPARQL query that selects items where the director is Clint Eastwood and he is also an actor in the film. In Wikidata, properties can be represented as wd: followed by the P number, and entities as wd:Q followed by the entity number.\n\nThe structure in SPARQL would be similar. Using the same triple pattern, but adjusting the prefixes. In Wikidata, it's common to use the `wd:` prefix for entities and `wdt:` for property values.\n\nSo the query would start with SELECT, then specify the variable, probably ?item for the film. Then, in the WHERE clause, I need to specify two conditions: that the director is Clint Eastwood and that he is an actor in the film.\n\nPutting it together, the query should look something like:\n\nSELECT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P57 wd:Q43203 .\n  ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n\nThis selects items (films) where both P57 (director) and P161 (actor) are Clint Eastwood. I should also include 'DISTINCT' to avoid duplicates, so it would be SELECT DISTINCT ?item.\n\nI should test to make sure this makes sense. Each triple correctly references the Wikidata entities and properties. P57 is the director, P161 is the starring role. Both are pointing to Clint Eastwood's entity. This should give all films where he directed and acted.\n\nI think that's it. Now, I just need to present this step-by-step and provide the final query.\n</think>\n\nTo create the equivalent SPARQL query for Wikidata, we'll map each component of the original DBpedia query to Wikidata's entities and properties using the provided ER2 mapping.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main elements**\n- **Director Property**: In DBpedia, it's `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/director>`, which maps to `P57` in Wikidata.\n- **Starring Property**: In DBpedia, it's `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring>`, which maps to `P161` in Wikidata.\n- **Clint Eastwood**: In DBpedia, it's `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Eastwood>`, which maps to `Q43203` in Wikidata.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the SPARQL Query**\nUsing the mappings, replace each DBpedia component with its corresponding Wikidata counterpart:\n- Use `wdt:` for properties and `wd:` for entities.\n- The triple patterns become `?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q43203` and `?uri wdt:P161 wd:Q43203`.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query**\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P57 wd:Q43203 .\n  ?item wdt:P161 wd:Q43203 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves items (films) where Clint Eastwood is both the director and an actor."

Let me start by understanding what the original query was for DBpedia (KG1).\n\nThe original SPARQL query for DBpedia was:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_African_CFA_franc> }\n\nThis query selects all URIs (countries) that have the West African CFA franc as their currency. The predicate here is http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency, and the object is the West African CFA franc.\n\nNow, the task is to convert this query for Wikidata. I see that there's an Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2) provided which maps the DBpedia entities to Wikidata.\n\nLooking at ER2, the first entry maps DBpedia's currency property to Wikidata's P38. So, in Wikidata, the property for currency is P38.\n\nThe second entry maps the West African CFA franc in DBpedia to Wikidata's Q861690. So, in Wikidata, the West African CFA franc is identified by Q861690.\n\nNow, in SPARQL for Wikidata, the syntax is a bit different. Instead of using angle brackets for IRIs, we usually use prefixes like wd: and wdt:. So, wd:Q861690 would represent the West African CFA franc entity, and wdt:P38 would represent the currency property.\n\nThe structure of the SPARQL query would be similar but using the Wikidata prefixes. We need to select the countries (items) that have the currency as West African CFA franc. \n\nSo, the query would look like:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P38 wd:Q861690\n}\n\nLet me explain this step-by-step:\n\n1. SELECT DISTINCT ?item: This selects the distinct items (countries) that meet the condition.\n2. WHERE { ... }: This specifies the conditions for the query.\n3. ?item wdt:P38 wd:Q861690: This means that the item (country) has a property P38 (currency) with the value Q861690 (West African CFA franc).\n\nI think that's correct. I should make sure that the query fetches all countries where the currency used is the West African CFA franc in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to use the corresponding Wikidata entities and properties from the provided mapping.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify the Property:** The currency property in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/currency) maps to Wikidata's P38 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P38).\n2. **Identify the Entity:** The West African CFA franc in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q861690 (http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q861690).\n3. **Construct the Query:** The query selects items (countries) where the 'currency' property (P38) is 'West African CFA franc' (Q861690).\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P38 wd:Q861690\n}\n</sparql>"

Let me start by understanding what the original query does.\n\nThe original query uses DBpedia's ontology and resource namespaces. It selects the population total of Iraq. So, the main goal is to replicate this in Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I should look at the ER2 mapping provided. I see that DBpedia's Iraq is mapped to two Wikidata entities: Q796 and Q3041595. I know Q796 is the main entity for Iraq, so I'll use that.\n\nNext, the populationTotal property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P1082. So, I need to use P1082 in the new query.\n\nNow, in Wikidata, the prefix for entities is usually `wd`, and for properties, it's `wpt`. But sometimes, people use `ps` and `p` for property statements. I should check the correct prefixes, but I'll proceed with `wd` and `wprop` since they are standard.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select the population where Iraq (Q796) has the P1082 property. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax and prefixes. I'll also include the necessary prefix declarations at the beginning.\n\nAlright, let me write the SPARQL query now.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata), we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding entities and properties in Wikidata.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Resource and Property in DBpedia:**\n   - The resource in DBpedia is `dbr:Iraq`, which corresponds to the country Iraq.\n   - The property in DBpedia is `dbo:populationTotal`, which represents the total population.\n\n2. **Map the Resource to Wikidata:**\n   - From the ER2 mapping, `dbr:Iraq` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q796` in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Map the Property to Wikidata:**\n   - From the ER2 mapping, `dbo:populationTotal` maps to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1082` (population total) in Wikidata.\n\n4. **Construct the SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n   - Use the `PREFIX` declarations for Wikidata (`wd` and `wprop`).\n   - Use the mapped resource `wd:Q796` for Iraq.\n   - Use the mapped property `wprop:P1082` for population total.\n   - Retrieve the population value using `?pIraq`.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wprop: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT ?pIraq WHERE {\n  wd:Q796 wprop:P1082 ?pIraq\n}\n```\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wprop: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT ?pIraq WHERE {\n  wd:Q796 wprop:P1082 ?pIraq\n}\n</sparql>"

They also gave some mapping between DBpedia and Wikidata entities. Let's understand what's going on here.\n\nThe DBpedia query is selecting distinct URIs where the type is dbo:Holiday. So, it's fetching all holidays from DBpedia. Now, the user wants me to create a similar query but for Wikidata instead.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia Holiday ontology class corresponds to Wikidata's Q1445650. That's the key here. In Wikidata, entities are identified by Q numbers, and in this case, Q1445650 represents \"holiday.\"\n\nNow, in SPARQL for Wikidata, we don't use 'rdf:type' like in DBpedia. Instead, we use 'wdt:P31' which stands for \"instance of.\" So, to find all holidays in Wikidata, I need to find all items where the instance is Q1445650.\n\nPutting this together, the query structure would be selecting distinct items where they are of type wdt:P31 and the value is wd:Q1445650.

So, the final query should have the PREFIX declaration and then the SELECT statement as discussed.\n\nJust to double-check, I'm making sure that I'm using the correct predicates and that I'm retrieving the right type of entities. Using 'wdt:P31' is correct for instance of, and 'wd:Q1445650' is indeed the holiday entity.\n\nAlright, I think that covers the reasoning and construction of the SPARQL query for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Goal:** The task is to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to retrieve holidays celebrated worldwide, similar to the DBpedia query provided.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Wikidata Entity:**\n   - From the ER2 mapping, the DBpedia Holiday class (`dbo:Holiday`) corresponds to Wikidata's `Q1445650`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use the Wikidata prefix `wdt` for properties and `wd` for entities.\n   - Replace `rdf:type` with `wdt:P31` to denote \"instance of\" in Wikidata.\n   - Select all distinct items of type `Q1445650`.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE\n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q1445650\n}\n```\n\nThis query fetches all items in Wikidata that are classified as holidays."

I'm starting with the DBpedia query provided and the entity and relation mappings. \n\nFirst, looking at the DBpedia query, it's selecting URIs of political parties in Greece that have an ideology of Pro-Europeanism. The structure is clear: it's filtering by type (PoliticalParty), country (Greece), and ideology (Pro-Europeanism). \n\nNow, to translate this into Wikidata's terms using the provided mappings. The first mapping is from DBpedia's PoliticalParty to Wikidata's Q7278. That means in Wikidata, I need to use 'wd:Q7278' to represent political parties. Next, the country is mapped from DBpedia's 'Greece' to Wikidata's Q41. So, in Wikidata, I'll look for items where the country is Q41.\n\nThe ideology part is a bit trickier. DBpedia uses 'Pro-Europeanism' which maps to two Wikidata items: Q3781399 and Q1377153. Since SPARQL allows for multiple values, I can include both in the query to cover all possibilities. \n\nPutting this all together, the query structure should be: select distinct items where each item is a political party (P31:Q7278), is from Greece (P17:Q41), and has an ideology of either Q3781399 or Q1377153 (P1142). \n\nI also need to ensure I'm using the correct prefixes, so I'll include 'PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>' and 'PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>'. \n\nI should also make sure to format the query correctly, using parentheses for the VALUES clause since it includes multiple values for ideology. Testing this should return the URIs of all pro-European Greek political parties in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Knowledge Graph 2 (Wikidata) that answers the question \"Which Greek parties are pro-European?\", we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata using the provided Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2). Let's build this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirements**: We need to find political parties that are based in Greece and have a pro-European ideology.\n\n2. **Mapping DBpedia to Wikidata**:\n   - **PoliticalParty** in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty>`) maps to **Q7278** in Wikidata (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7278`).\n   - **country** in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>`) maps to **P17** in Wikidata (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P17`).\n   - **Greece** in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece>`) maps to **Q41** in Wikidata (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q41`).\n   - **ideology** in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ideology>`) maps to **P1142** in Wikidata (`http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1142`).\n   - **Pro-Europeanism** in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pro-Europeanism>`) maps to **Q3781399** and **Q1377153** in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Constructing the SPARQL Query**:\n   - We select distinct items (`?item`) that are political parties.\n   - We filter items that are based in Greece.\n   - We further filter items that have the ideology \"Pro-Europeanism\".\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q7278.\n    ?item wdt:P17 wd:Q41.\n    ?item wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399, wd:Q1377153.\n}\n```\n\nExplanation of the query:\n- `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q7278` ensures that the item is a political party.\n- `?item wdt:P17 wd:Q41` ensures that the political party is based in Greece.\n- `?item wdt:P1142 wd:Q3781399, wd:Q1377153` ensures that the political party has the ideology of \"Pro-Europeanism\".\n\nThis query will return all Greek political parties that are pro-European according to Wikidata."

They already have a SPARQL query for DBpedia, but now they want one for Wikidata. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original DBpedia query. It's selecting distinct dates where the Charmed resource has a starring relation to an actor, who in turn has a birthDate. The structure is straightforward, but since we're moving to Wikidata, the properties and identifiers will change.\n\nThe context provides an ER2 mapping, which is crucial. It maps DBpedia IDs to Wikidata IDs. So, I need to replace each DBpedia part with its Wikidata counterpart.\n\nStarting with the resource: DBpedia's Charmed is http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charmed, which maps to Wikidata's Q162371. So, in Wikidata, I'll use wd:Q162371.\n\nNext, the starring property in DBpedia is http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring, which maps to Wikidata's P161. So, in the SPARQL query, that becomes p:P161.\n\nFor the birthDate, DBpedia uses http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthDate, which maps to Wikidata's P569. However, in Wikidata, the property for birth date is usually a qualifier, so I'll need to use pq:P569. This way, I'm accessing the correct property.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The main query structure should select the birth dates. So, I'll write something like SELECT ?date WHERE { ... }. The where clause needs to connect Charmed to its actors and then to their birth dates. In SPARQL, I'll structure this as a path: Charmed -> starring -> actor -> birthDate. Using the mappings, that becomes wd:Q162371 p:P161 ?actor . ?actor pq:P569 ?date.\n\nBut wait, in Wikidata, sometimes you might need to use a different approach for qualifiers or to make the query more efficient. However, in this case, the structure seems straightforward. Each actor has a p:P161 pointing to them, and each has a pq:P569 for their birth date.\n\nI should test this structure to make sure. Using the mappings correctly is key here. Don't forget 'DISTINCT' to avoid duplicate dates if any actors share the same birth date, although that's unlikely.\n\nSo, the final query will be selecting distinct dates, following the path through P161 and P569. I think that's it. Ready to write the final query.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) that retrieves the birthdays of all actors from the television show *Charmed*, we need to map the DBpedia-based query to Wikidata's entities and properties using the provided ER2 mapping. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and the final query:\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Target Entities and Properties**:\n   - The television show *Charmed* is represented in DBpedia as `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charmed>`, which maps to Wikidata's `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q162371`.\n   - The \"starring\" property in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring>`) maps to Wikidata's \"cast member\" property (`P161`).\n   - The \"birthDate\" property in DBpedia (`<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthDate>`) maps to Wikidata's \"date of birth\" property (`P569`).\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query**:\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique birth dates.\n   - Use the Wikidata identifier for *Charmed* (`wd:Q162371`).\n   - Use the Wikidata property for \"cast member\" (`p:P161`) to link *Charmed* to its actors.\n   - Use the Wikidata property for \"date of birth\" (`pq:P569`) to retrieve the birth dates of the actors.\n\n---\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?date WHERE {\n  wd:Q162371 p:P161 ?actor .\n  ?actor pq:P569 ?date .\n}\n```\n\n</sparql>\n\nThis query retrieves the birth dates of all actors associated with the television show *Charmed* in Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the given information. The original query was for DBpedia, and I see that the user has provided a mapping between the entities and relations of DBpedia and Wikidata.\n\nFirst, looking at the existing SPARQL query for DBpedia:\n\n```\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  res:The_Three_Dancers dbo:author ?person .\n  ?person dbo:movement ?uri \n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the movement (artistic style) of the painter who authored \"The Three Dancers\". \n\nNow, I need to translate this into a Wikidata SPARQL query using the provided mapping. Let me analyze each part:\n\n1. **Prefixes**: In DBpedia, the prefixes are `dbo` for the ontology and `res` for resources. In Wikidata, the main prefix I think I need is `wd` for the entities and `wdt` for the properties, along with `p` and `ps` for qualifiers if needed.\n\n2. **Subject**: The resource is \"The Three Dancers\". In the mapping, the DBpedia ID is `http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Three_Dancers`, which maps to Wikidata ID `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3235867`. So, I'll replace `res:The_Three_Dancers` with `wd:Q3235867`.\n\n3. **Predicate (author)**: The predicate `dbo:author` maps to Wikidata's `P50`, which is `author`. In SPARQL, Wikidata properties are usually accessed using `wdt:P50`.\n\n4. **Object (person)**: This part is a variable, `?person`, so that stays the same.\n\n5. **Movement**: The movement is `dbo:movement`, which maps to `P135` in Wikidata. So, I'll use `wdt:P135` for the movement predicate and `?uri` as the variable.\n\nPutting this together, the structure of the query should be:\n\n- Select the distinct `?uri`.\n- WHERE clause: `wd:Q3235867` has an author (`wdt:P50`) that is `?person`.\n- `?person` has a movement (`wdt:P135`) which is `?uri`.\n\nI also need to include the necessary prefixes. In Wikidata, the common practice is to use `wd:` for entities, `wdt:` for direct properties, and `p` or `ps` for more complex relationships, but in this simple case, I think `wdt:` is sufficient.\n\nSo, the prefixes I'll include are:\n- `PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>`\n- `PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>`\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query should select the movement URI(s) based on the structured data in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n1. **Identify the resource**: Replace DBpedia's \"The Three Dancers\" with Wikidata's Q3235867.\n2. **Use the correct properties**: Convert `dbo:author` and `dbo:movement` to Wikidata's `wdt:P50` and `wdt:P135`, respectively.\n3. **Include necessary prefixes**: Use `wd` for entities and `wdt` for direct properties.\n\nHere's the final query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n  ?person wdt:P135 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the artistic movement (`?uri`) of the painter who authored \"The Three Dancers\" (Q3235867) using Wikidata's entities and properties.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q3235867 wdt:P50 ?person .\n  ?person wdt:P135 ?uri\n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata that will find all the actors born in Germany. I have some context here about how it's done in DBpedia, so I think I can use that to map over to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, in the DBpedia query, it's selecting distinct URIs where the entity is an Actor, and either the birthPlace is Germany or the birthPlace has a country which is Germany. So I need to replicate that logic but using Wikidata's entities and properties.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided:\n\n- Actor in DBpedia is mapped to Q33999 in Wikidata.\n- birthPlace is mapped to P19 in Wikidata.\n- Germany in DBpedia maps to Q183, Q43287, and Q41304, but I think the main one is Q183.\n- country is mapped to P17.\n\nSo, translating the DBpedia query to Wikidata, I need to find all items that are instances of Actor (Q33999) and have either P19 (birthPlace) directly linked to Germany (Q183) or have a P19 linking to some place, which in turn has P17 (country) linking to Q183.\n\nI remember in SPARQL, you can use the ' Union ' operator to combine two patterns. So the first part would be where the actor has P19->Q183. The second part would be where the actor has P19->?place and ?place has P17->Q183.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to structure the query to select distinct items, using these patterns. Also, using 'SERVICE <http://www.wikidata.org/sparql>' if needed, but I think Wikidata allows querying without that.\n\nI should make sure to use the correct prefixes for Wikidata, though sometimes the default can be WD, but often in examples, the prefixes are defined at the top. Let me check if I need to include them. For simplicity, maybe I can write it without explicit prefixes using the full URIs.\n\nSo, in the WHERE clause, I'll have two parts connected by UNION. Each part will have the conditions on P19 and the rest.\n\nWait, also, in the ER2 mapping, Germany is mapped to multiple Wikidata entities. Should I include all of them? Probably, but maybe Q183 is the main one. Including all might make the query more accurate, but could also complicate it. Since the user's example from DBpedia used just Germany, I think using Q183 is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a VALUES clause to include all possible Germany entities. That might be more thorough. So in the WHERE clause, I could use a filter where the birthPlace or the place's country is one of those entities.\n\nHmm, but looking back at the DBpedia query, it's matching either birthPlace is Germany or birthPlace's country is Germany. So in Wikidata, the equivalent would be where P19 is Q183, or where the P19's place has P17 as Q183.\n\nTherefore, the query structure would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P19 wd:Q183\n  UNION\n  ?uri wdt:P19 ?place .\n  ?place wdt:P17 wd:Q183\n}\n\nAnd added as part of the selection, since the URI is the subject.\n\nI think that covers the necessary parts. Now, I should write the SPARQL query accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo find actors born in Germany using Wikidata, we need to translate the DBpedia SPARQL query into Wikidata's schema. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Actors**: Use Wikidata's Actor entity (Q33999).\n2. **Direct Birthplace Check**: Use property P19 (birthPlace) to check if birthPlace is Q183 (Germany).\n3. **Indirect via Country**: Use P19 to find a place, then P17 (country) of that place to be Q183.\n\nThe SPARQL query combines these checks using UNION.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  {\n    ?uri wdt:P19 wd:Q183\n  }\n  UNION\n  {\n    ?uri wdt:P19 ?place .\n    ?place wdt:P17 wd:Q183\n  }\n}\n```"

First, I'll look at what the user provided.\n\nThey have a natural language question asking who designed the Brooklyn Bridge. They also provided a SPARQL query for DBpedia, which uses the dbo:architect property. The Knowledge Graph 1 is DBpedia, and Knowledge Graph 2 is Wikidata. There's also an ER2 mapping that links the DBpedia IDs to Wikidata IDs.\n\nSo, the main idea is to convert the DBpedia query to Wikidata. I know that in Wikidata, properties are usually denoted with 'P' numbers and entities with 'Q' numbers. From the ER2, I see that DBpedia's architect (dbo:architect) maps to Wikidata's P84. Also, the Brooklyn Bridge in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's Q125006.\n\nI need to structure the SPARQL query for Wikidata. The PREFIX for Wikidata is typically wdt and p. So, I'll use PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> and PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>.\n\nIn the query, I'll select the architect's URI. The Brooklyn Bridge entity is wd:Q125006, and the property is wdt:P84. So, putting it all together, the query will select the architect where the Brooklyn Bridge's architect is stated.\n\nI should explain each part: the prefixes, the SELECT clause, and how the triple is formed.

I know from the context provided that the natural language question is \"Who wrote the Game of Thrones theme?\" and that the DBpedia SPARQL query is using the composer property.\n\nFirst, I remember that the DBpedia query uses dbo:composer, so I need to find the equivalent property in Wikidata. From the ER2 mapping, I see that dbo:composer maps to wikidata's P86. So in Wikidata, instead of dbo:composer, I'll use p:P86.\n\nNext, the resource for Game of Thrones in DBpedia is res:Game_of_Thrones. Looking at the ER2 mapping again, the DBpedia resource http://dbpedia.org/resource/Game_of_Thrones corresponds to Wikidata's Q23572. So in Wikidata, I'll need to refer to wd:Q23572 instead of res:Game_of_Thrones.\n\nThe original query in DBpedia is selecting the ?uri where the resource has the composer property. Since in Wikidata, we're using the same structure but with their own prefixes, I'll structure it similarly. I'll use the wd prefix for the entity and p for the property.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select ?uri where wd:Q23572 is linked via p:P86 to ?uri. I should also include the necessary prefixes at the beginning of the query: one for the entity (wd) and one for the property (p).\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. In Wikidata, properties are usually referenced with p: and p:P86 is the correct way to denote the composer property. The entity is clearly wd:Q23572 for Game of Thrones.\n\nSo the final query should look like:\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q23572 p:P86 ?uri }\n\nWait, let me double-check the prefixes. I think in Wikidata, the property prefix can also be abbreviated as 'p:', and the entity as 'wd:', so I think that's correct.

I'm a bit new to SPARQL and Wikidata, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the user provided a similar query for DBpedia, which was KG1. In that query, they selected films where the director is Francis Ford Coppola. So, I need to do something similar but using Wikidata's structure.\n\nI know that in SPARQL, the structure is usually PREFIXES followed by the SELECT clause and then the WHERE clause with the triples. The prefixes will define the namespaces. For Wikidata, I think the main prefix is wd, and wdt for the properties. So, I'll start with:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nNext, the SELECT clause. Since I want to retrieve the URIs of the movies, I'll select ?movie.\n\nIn the WHERE clause, I need to state that ?movie is a film and that its director is Francis Ford Coppola. From the ER2 provided earlier, I see that:\n\n- The concept of \"Film\" in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's Q11424, so I'll use wd:Q11424 for the type.\n- The \"director\" property in DBpedia corresponds to Wikidata's P57, so I'll use wdt:P57.\n- Francis Ford Coppola's resource in DBpedia is mapped to wd:Q56094 in Wikidata.\n\nPutting this together, each triple is:\n\n?movie wdt:P31 wd:Q11424.   (This states that the movie is an instance of Film)\n?movie wdt:P57 wd:Q56094.   (This states that the director is Francis Ford Coppola)\n\nI should also include a DISTINCT keyword to avoid duplicates.\n\nWait, in the DBpedia query, they used rdf:type dbo:Film. In Wikidata, the equivalent is using wdt:P31, which stands for \"instance of\". So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's all. Let me assemble it all together.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **PREFIXES**: Define the relevant namespaces for Wikidata properties and entities.\n2. **SELECT Clause**: Specify that we want to retrieve the movie URIs.\n3. **WHERE Clause**: Define the two conditions that the movie must satisfy, being a film and directed by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?movie\nWHERE {\n  ?movie wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n          wdt:P57 wd:Q56094 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct movies from Wikidata where each movie is an instance of \"Film\" and directed by Francis Ford Coppola."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find Adele's birth name. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the user provided a context with a question, SPARQL query for DBpedia, and some mappings between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and relations. The original question was about Adele's birth name, and the DBpedia query used dbo:birthName. The ER2 mappings showed that dbr:Adele corresponds to wikidata:Q23215 and dbo:birthName corresponds to wikidata:P1477. So, I need to translate the DBpedia query into one that works for Wikidata.\n\nI know that SPARQL queries for Wikidata typically use the prefix wd: for entities and p: for properties. So, instead of using DBpedia's dbo:birthName, I should use Wikidata's P1477. The property in Wikidata for birth name is P1477, but in the query, I think I might need to use p:p1477 and then specify the actual property with ps:p1477, but I'm a little confused about that part. Maybe I should just use the property directly with wd:P1477.\n\nWait, no, I think Wikidata's SPARQL requires using the property with the p: and ps: prefixes. So, the property statement would involve both p:p1477 and ps:p1477. Alternatively, maybe I can use just the wd:P1477 directly. I'm not entirely sure, but I think in the query, it's something like ?s p:P1477 ?bn.\n\nThe entity for Adele in DBpedia is dbr:Adele, which maps to wd:Q23215 in Wikidata. So in the SPARQL query, I should use wd:Q23215 as the subject.\n\nPutting it together, I need to select the birth name where Adele has the birth name property. So, the basic structure would be SELECT ?bn WHERE { wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn }.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should include the condition that the birth name is a monolingual text so that it returns the name with the correct language. So, adding a filter to check if the value is a string might help, but I'm not sure how that works in Wikidata. Maybe I should use the schema for monolingual text, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I can just retrieve the value of the property without any additional conditions, so the query remains simple: SELECT ?bn WHERE { wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn }.\n\nI should also prefix the query with the appropriate namespaces. In Wikidata, the common prefixes are wd: and wds:. Wait, no, wd is for entities and properties, and for statements, it's p: and ps:. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn the query, the property is P1477, so it should be accessed with p:P1477. The subject is wd:Q23215. So the triple would be wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn. But I also remember that properties in Wikidata SPARQL often use the RDF predicate p: and then the specific property as part of the IRI, so I think the predicate is p:p1477, and the object is the value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nSELECT ?bn WHERE { wd:Q23215 wds:P1477 ?bn }\n\nThat way, I'm using the direct property. Alternatively, maybe the longer form is better for clarity.\n\nNo, I think the correct way is to use the wd: prefix for the entity and the p: and ps: for properties. But I'm not totally sure. Maybe it's better to write it using the p: prefix for the property. So:\n\nSELECT ?bn WHERE {\n  <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23215> <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/P1477> ?bn\n}\n\nBut that's using the full IRIs, which is correct but maybe not necessary. It's better to use prefixes for readability. So, setting up the prefixes:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\nPREFIX ps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/>\nPREFIX pq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/>\n\nBut I think for this query, I don't need any qualifiers, just the statement. So maybe:\n\nSELECT ?bn WHERE {\n  wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn\n}\n\nThat should work because p:P1477 is the correct property path. I think p: is the prefix for the property with the statement, so that should return the value.\n\nI'm still a bit unsure if I'm using the prefixes correctly, but I think this structure is right. Let me check an example. If I look up a similar query, say for another person's birth name, does it use p:P1477? I think so.\n\nAlright, I think the final SPARQL query would be using the wd:Q23215 as the subject and p:P1477 as the predicate to retrieve the birth name.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find Adele's birth name, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Entity**: Adele is represented in Wikidata as `wd:Q23215`.\n2. **Identify the Property**: The birth name property in Wikidata is `P1477`, which translates to `p:P1477` in SPARQL.\n3. **Construct the Query**: Use the entity and property to form the query, selecting the birth name.\n\n**SPARQL Query Explanation**:\n- `PREFIX` declarations define the namespaces for the query.\n- `SELECT ?bn` specifies that we want the birth name.\n- `WHERE { wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn }` retrieves the value where Adele has the birth name property.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX p: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/>\n\nSELECT ?bn WHERE {\n  wd:Q23215 p:P1477 ?bn\n}\n</sparql>"

I know that in the previous example, DBpedia was used, and now I have to convert that SPARQL query to work with Wikidata.\n\nFirst, looking at the original query. It selects the URI of albums by Queen, ordered by release date. The prefixes used are dbo and rdf. The query finds albums where the artist is Queen and sorts them by release date.\n\nNow, I need to map DBpedia elements to Wikidata. The ER2 list gives me the mappings. The Album in DBpedia is wikidata's Q482994. The artist property is P175 in Wikidata. The Queen band is Q15862, and releaseDate is P577.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the query should find items that are instances of Album (Q482994), created by (P175) Queen (Q15862), and have a release date (P577). I'll need to order these by release date and limit the result to the earliest one.\n\nI should use the same structure but replace the prefixes. Instead of dbo: and rdf:, I'll use wdt: for properties and wd: for entities. The query will look for ?item, and filter by the type, artist, and release date, then order and limit.\n\nWait, in Wikidata, the release date might have earlier dates as the first album. I need to ensure that the ordering is correct. Also, I should make sure that the SERVICE clause isn't needed here since it's a standard query.\n\nPutting it all together, I select ?item where it's an album, by Queen, with a release date. Order by the date and limit to one. This should give me the first album.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding Wikidata identifiers using the provided ER2 mappings. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the entity**: The entity we are interested in is \"Queen albums.\"\n2. **Map Album**: In DBpedia, `dbo:Album` corresponds to `wd:Q482994` in Wikidata.\n3. **Map Artist**: The property `dbo:artist` in DBpedia corresponds to `wdt:P175` in Wikidata.\n4. **Map Queen (band)**: The resource `http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_(band)` corresponds to `wd:Q15862` in Wikidata.\n5. **Map Release Date**: The property `dbo:releaseDate` corresponds to `wdt:P577` in Wikidata.\n\nThe query is constructed to retrieve the first album by Queen, ordered by release date:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE \n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 .\n  ?item wdt:P175 wd:Q15862 .\n  ?item wdt:P577 ?date .\n}\nORDER BY ASC(?date)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query retrieves the first album by Queen in Wikidata by selecting items of type Album (`Q482994`), created by artist (`P175`) Queen (`Q15862`), with a release date (`P577`), ordered by the release date ascendingly and limited to the first result.\n\nFinal SPARQL:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE \n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 .\n  ?item wdt:P175 wd:Q15862 .\n  ?item wdt:P577 ?date .\n}\nORDER BY ASC(?date)\nLIMIT 1\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find out the currency of the Czech Republic, similar to how it was done using DBpedia (KG1). Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the DBpedia example, the query used the dbo:currency property and the resource res:Czech_Republic. The query looked like this:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/> \nPREFIX res: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE { \n  res:Czech_Republic dbo:currency ?uri \n}\n\nNow, since I'm switching to Wikidata, I need to adjust the prefixes and the property accordingly. From the ER2 mapping provided, I see that in Wikidata, the Czech Republic is represented by Q213, and the currency property is P38.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, entities start with Q followed by a number, and properties start with P. That means I should use wd:Q213 for the Czech Republic and wd:P38 for the currency property. The prefixes in Wikidata typically use 'wd' as the prefix.\n\nPutting this together, my query needs to select the currency value associated with Q213 using P38. I also need to make sure to fetch distinct results to avoid duplicates, though with countries, usually there's only one official currency, so duplicates might not be an issue, but it's good practice.\n\nI should also include the appropriate prefixes for Wikidata. Usually, it's 'wd' for entities and properties, and 'wds' for statements, but since P38 is a direct property, I might not need wds here. However, including 'wd' should suffice.\n\nNow, constructing the SPARQL query, I'll start by defining the PREFIX for Wikidata. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll link the Czech Republic's entity (Q213) to the currency property (P38) and return the value as ?currency.\n\nSo the query would look like:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?currency \nWHERE { \n  wd:Q213 p:P38 ?currency \n}\n\nWait, but in Wikidata, sometimes properties have different representations, including using p:P38 for the property and then maybe a qualifier, but since we just want the main currency, p:P38 should be enough. Alternatively, sometimes it's represented as wd:P38, but I think the correct way is to use p:P38 with the prefix. Actually, the property in SPARQL is written as p:P38, but I think in the query, it's just P38 with the wd prefix.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: in Wikidata, to reference a property, you can use the prefix wd, so wd:P38 is the currency property. But in SPARQL, how is it written? It might be either wd:P38 or using p:P38 with a different prefix. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use 'wd' for the entity and 'p' for the property. Wait, no, that's not correct. In Wikidata, the properties are under the same namespace as entities, so actually, the correct prefix is 'wd' for both entities and properties. So I should write wd:Q213 for the entity and wd:P38 for the property.\n\nSo the query should be:\n\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?currency \nWHERE { \n  wd:Q213 wd:P38 ?currency \n}\n\nYes, that makes sense. I can test this by maybe looking up the currency of another country to see if the structure holds, but I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in Wikidata, the property is written as 'wds:currency' but I think that's when it's a specific datatype. No, actually, properties are in wd, so it's wd:P38.\n\nTherefore, the final query should select the currency where the subject is the Czech Republic (Q213) and the property is P38.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to query the currency property of the Czech Republic. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Prefixes**: Use 'wd' for Wikidata entities and properties.\n2. **Entity**: The Czech Republic is Q213.\n3. **Property**: The currency property is P38.\n\nThe SPARQL query retrieves the value associated with P38 for Q213.\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \nSELECT DISTINCT ?currency \nWHERE { \n  wd:Q213 wd:P38 ?currency \n}\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so the user is asking me to figure out how to construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding what they have. They have a question: \"Which bridges cross the Seine?\" and a corresponding SPARQL query for DBpedia. They also provided an entity and relation mapping between DBpedia and Wikidata. My task is to translate that DBpedia query into a Wikidata query.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the original query. The query selects distinct URIs where the URI is a bridge and crosses the Seine. In DBpedia, that's done using the Bridge ontology and the crosses property pointing to the Seine resource.\n\nNow, looking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia Bridge corresponds to Wikidata's Q12280, which is \"bridge.\" The crosses property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P177, \"crosses.\" The Seine in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities: Q1142326, which I think is the Seine River, and Q1471, which might be another related entity.\n\nWait, why two entities for Seine? Maybe Q1471 is another representation or a more general one, but I think Q1142326 is the correct one for the river. I'll use that one.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the query needs to find items that are instances of bridge (Q12280) and use the P177 property to cross the Seine (Q1142326). I'll use the same structure: select distinct the item where the item is a bridge and it crosses Q1142326.\n\nPutting it all together, the SPARQL query would select ?item where it has the instance of Q12280 and has the P177 property pointing to Q1142326. I should also specify the prefixes for easier reading, using wdt for properties and wd for entities.\n\nI think that's it. I'll structure the query accordingly, making sure to use the correct prefixes and syntax for Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the given context, we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to their corresponding entities and properties in Wikidata. Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Mapping the Entity for \"Bridge\":**\n   - In DBpedia, the entity for \"Bridge\" is represented by `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Bridge>`.\n   - In Wikidata, the equivalent entity is `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12280>` (a bridge).\n\n2. **Mapping the Property for \"crosses\":**\n   - In DBpedia, the property for \"crosses\" is `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/crosses>`.\n   - In Wikidata, the equivalent property is `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P177>` (crosses).\n\n3. **Mapping the Entity for \"Seine\":**\n   - In DBpedia, the entity for \"Seine\" is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine>`.\n   - In Wikidata, the equivalent entity is `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1142326>` (Seine River) or `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1471>` (another representation of the Seine). For this query, we will use `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1142326>`.\n\n4. **Constructing the SPARQL Query:**\n   - We need to retrieve all entities that are instances of \"Bridge\" (Q12280) and that \"crosses\" (P177) the Seine River (Q1142326).\n\nThe final SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item \nWHERE \n{\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q12280 ;  # ?item is a bridge\n    wdt:P177 wd:Q1142326   # ?item crosses the Seine River\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves all distinct items in Wikidata that are bridges and cross the Seine River."

I remember that in the DBpedia query, they used specific properties like 'creator' and 'TelevisionShow', so I need to map those to Wikidata equivalents.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the correct entity for John Cleese. From the ER2 mapping, I see that DBpedia's John Cleese is linked to Wikidata's Q25014. So I'll use wd:Q25014 in the Wikidata query.\n\nNext, the television show in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's Q15416. So the type should be wd:Q15416.\n\nThe 'creator' property in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P170. In Wikidata, properties are prefixed with 'wdt:' or 'p:' and 'ps:'. I think I'll use 'wdt:P170' here because it directly states the creator relationship without qualifiers.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select all items where the item is a television show (Q15416) and has creator John Cleese (Q25014) via P170.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it with a prefix for clarity.

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find all writers who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in the previous example, the user was using DBpedia with a SPARQL query. The query selected writers who won the Nobel Prize in Literature by checking if they belong to the Writer class and have an award relation to the Nobel Prize. But now, the task is to do the equivalent query in Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, it shows how the DBpedia entities map to Wikidata. Specifically:\n\n- The DBpedia ontology Writer (dbpedia:Writer) maps to Wikidata's Q36180, which I believe represents writers there.\n- The 'award' property in DBpedia (dbpedia:award) maps to Wikidata's P166. So, in Wikidata, to find awards, we use P166.\n- The Nobel Prize in Literature in DBpedia maps to Q37922 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, to translate the original SPARQL query for DBpedia into Wikidata's terms, I need to:\n\n1. Replace the class check from `a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Writer>` to being an instance of Q36180 in Wikidata. In SPARQL, using Wikidata, we can represent this with `wdt:P31 wd:Q36180`, where `wdt:P31` is the property for \"instance of\" and `wd:Q36180` is the writer class.\n\n2. Replace the award relation from `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/award>` to `wds:P166` (or `wdt:P166`), which is the correct property in Wikidata for awards.\n\n3. The Nobel Prize in Literature is `wd:Q37922` in Wikidata.\n\nPutting this together, I need to find all entities (`?uri`) that are writers and have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, we often use the `wdt:` prefix for properties and `wd:` for entities. So, the query structure would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 .\n  ?uri wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n\nThis seems correct, but let me double-check if I'm using the right prefixes and if the properties are correct. I'm a bit unsure about whether to use `wdt:` or `p:` for properties, but I think `wdt:` is standard for direct property access.\n\nAnother point is whether `P31` is indeed \"instance of\". Yes, `P31` stands for \"instance of\" in Wikidata. So, using `wdt:P31` is appropriate to state that the entity is a writer.\n\nI should also ensure that I'm selecting distinct URIs to avoid duplicates, so `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri` makes sense.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n1. Map DBpedia classes and properties to Wikidata using the ER2 provided.\n2. Structure the SPARQL query using the correct Wikidata properties and prefixes.\n3. Ensure the query correctly identifies writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nI think that's all. Let me put the final query together.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, we mapped the DBpedia entities to their corresponding Wikidata entities using the provided ER2 mapping. The class, property, and award are translated as follows:\n\n1. `dbpedia:Writer` \u2192 `wikidata:Q36180`\n2. `dbpedia:award` \u2192 `wikidata:P166`\n3. `dbpedia:Nobel_Prize_in_Literature` \u2192 `wikidata:Q37922`\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata is constructed by selecting entities that are instances of 'writer' and have received the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Use `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri` to fetch unique entities.\n2. Use `?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q36180` to specify that the entity is a writer.\n3. Use `?uri wdt:P166 wd:Q37922` to indicate the entity has won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n       wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n```\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe final, complete SPARQL query for Wikidata is:\n\n<sparql>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q36180 ;\n       wdt:P166 wd:Q37922 .\n}\n</sparql>"

Let me start by understanding the information given.\n\nIn the context, the user provided the original SPARQL query for DBpedia (KG1), which is:\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)> dbo:discoverer ?uri\n}\n\nSo, in KG1, the resource for Ceres is identified by the URI <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)>, and the property used to find the discoverer is dbo:discoverer.\n\nNow, I need to map these to Wikidata. The ER2 mapping provided includes two entities. The first one maps the DBpedia Ceres resource to Wikidata's Q596. The second maps the DBpedia ontology discoverer property (dbo:discoverer) to Wikidata's property P61.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the URI for Ceres is http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q596, and the property to find the discoverer is P61, which I believe stands for \"discoverer\" or \"inventor\".\n\nIn Wikidata, to use properties in SPARQL, I have to prefix them with 'wdt:', so P61 becomes wdt:P61. Similarly, the entity Q596 is referenced as wd:Q596.\n\nThe general structure of a SPARQL query in Wikidata starts with the PREFIX definitions. Typically, I'd include 'wd' for Wikidata entities and 'wdt' for properties. So, the prefixes would be:\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nThen, the SELECT statement remains the same, selecting ?uri to get the discoverer's URI.\n\nIn the WHERE clause, I need to use the Wikidata URI for Ceres and the Wikidata property for discoverer. So it becomes:\nwd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?uri\n\nPutting it all together, I construct the SPARQL query with the appropriate prefixes and the triple pattern in the WHERE clause.\n\nI should double-check if the property mapping is correct. Since P61 corresponds to the discoverer in Wikidata, using wdt:P61 should retrieve the right results.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the syntax is correct. Sometimes, depending on the endpoint, the prefixes might need to be declared, but I think including them is standard practice.\n\nSo, the final SPARQL query should correctly fetch the discoverer of Ceres from Wikidata using the mapped entities and properties.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Knowledge Graph:**\n   - The goal is to query Wikidata (KG2) instead of DBpedia (KG1).\n\n2. **Map Entities and Properties:**\n   - **Entity:** Ceres in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's `Q596`.\n   - **Property:** The `discoverer` property in DBpedia (`dbo:discoverer`) is mapped to Wikidata's `P61`.\n\n3. **Adjust SPARQL Syntax:**\n   - Wikidata requires the use of `wdt:` prefix for property names and `wd:` for entity identifiers.\n   - Accordingly, `dbo:discoverer` becomes `wdt:P61`, and the entity becomes `wd:Q596`.\n\n4. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Include necessary prefixes.\n   - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve the discoverer's URI.\n   - Form the triple pattern with the mapped entity and property.\n\n**SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q596 wdt:P61 ?uri\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the discoverer of Ceres from Wikidata by using the appropriate entity and property mappings."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user by creating a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the original query they provided for DBpedia (KG1). Let me start by understanding what the original query does.\n\nThe original query selects all distinct URIs where the subject has the occupation 'Bandleader' and plays the instrument 'Trumpet'. In DBpedia, the properties used are <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation> and <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/instrument>, with the resources being <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bandleader> and <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet> respectively.\n\nNow, looking at the entity and relation mapping provided, I can see that each DBpedia property and resource has corresponding Wikidata entities. For the 'occupation' property in DBpedia, the Wikidata equivalent is P106. The 'Bandleader' resource in DBpedia maps to two Wikidata entities, Q5280538 and Q806349. The 'instrument' property in DBpedia maps to P1303 in Wikidata, and 'Trumpet' maps to Q8338 and Q119621.\n\nSo, to translate the SPARQL query to Wikidata, I need to replace the DBpedia properties and resources with their Wikidata counterparts. I'll use the same structure but with the new entities. I should also select distinct URIs to avoid duplicates, just like in the original query.\n\nI need to construct the new query carefully, ensuring that each part is correctly mapped. I'll start with \"SELECT DISTINCT ?uri\" to get unique results. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll define the triples using the P106, P1303 properties and the respective Qnodes for Bandleader and Trumpet.\n\nI have to make sure to use the correct syntax for Wikidata SPARQL. Typically, Wikidata uses the prefix 'wd:' for entities and 'p:' for properties, but since the mapping provides the full URIs, I might need to use them directly or adjust accordingly. However, since the user hasn't specified prefixes, I'll construct the query without them, using the full URIs.\n\nPutting it all together, the new query should select all URIs that have both the occupation and instrument properties set to Bandleader and Trumpet respectively in Wikidata. I'll structure it with the necessary semicolons and write it in proper SPARQL syntax.\n\nI should double-check that I'm using the correct entities and that I'm not missing any. Since Bandleader has two Qnodes, I might need to include both, but I think in Wikidata, each entity is unique, so specifying both might not be necessary unless the query requires it. However, the original DBpedia query used a single resource, so perhaps in Wikidata, each Qnode represents a specific concept, so both might be correct and need to be included.\n\nBut for simplicity and to match the structure, I'll include each as part of the occupation, connected with 'wd:Q...'. Wait, actually, in Wikidata, each statement is a triple, so I can't list multiple values in the same predicate. Therefore, I might need to use a UNION or another approach if I want to include both. However, the original query used a single resource in DBpedia, so perhaps the Wikidata query can be constructed with each possible value. But the user hasn't specified whether to include both, so maybe the initial query should just use one. Alternatively, the system might handle it, but for now, I'll proceed with the entities provided.\n\nWait, looking back, in the mappings, 'Bandleader' maps to both Q5280538 and Q806349. So perhaps the query needs to account for both possibilities. Alternatively, the system can handle that with a single property and multiple values. Therefore, I should structure the query to include all entities that have occupation as either Q5280538 or Q806349 and play the instrument Q8338 or Q119621.\n\nBut wait, in Wikidata, the instrument might also have multiple identifiers, so I should include all possible trumpet entities. So, I might need to use multiple triples connected with semicolons and use UNION if necessary.\n\nHowever, the original DBpedia query didn't use UNION; it just used two triples connected by semicolons, which implies an AND condition. Therefore, in Wikidata, I can do the same. So, I'll write the query so that the subject has occupation as Bandleader (either Q) and instrument as Trumpet (either Q). But in the mappings, the trumpet resource maps to two entities, Q8338 and Q119621. Therefore, the instrument could be either of those.\n\nSo, to cover all possibilities, I should allow the instrument to be either Q8338 or Q119621. Similarly, the occupation should be either Q5280538 or Q806349. But in SPARQL, to match any of these, I can use the 'VALUES' clause or 'UNION'. However, using VALUES is more efficient and cleaner.\n\nTherefore, I can structure the query as:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 ?occ ;\n       wdt:P1303 ?ins .\n  VALUES ?occ { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n  VALUES ?ins { wd:Q8338 wd:Q119621 }\n}\n\nThis way, the query selects all URIs where the occupation is either of the two Bandleader Qnodes and the instrument is either of the two Trumpet Qnodes.\n\nBut looking at the mapping, the user provided the ER2 with the full URIs, so perhaps I should use the full URIs instead of the wd: prefix. However, typically in Wikidata, the properties are referenced with 'wdt:' as the prefix. So, I think using the full URIs might not be standard, so I'll adjust them with 'wd:' prefix.\n\nWait, no. The correct way in Wikidata SPARQL is to use 'wdt:' for the predicates and 'wd:' for entities. So, I'll structure the query accordingly.\n\nSo, the correct query would use 'wdt:P106' for occupation and 'wdt:P1303' for instrument. The values for occupation would be 'wd:Q5280538' and 'wd:Q806349', and for instrument 'wd:Q8338' and 'wd:Q119621'.\n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query would look like this:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 ?occ ;\n     wdt:P1303 ?ins .\n  VALUES ?occ { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n  VALUES ?ins { wd:Q8338 wd:Q119621 }\n}\n\nThis ensures that any entity with either of the Bandleader occupations and either of the Trumpet instruments is selected.\n\nI think this is the correct approach. It covers all possible mappings and uses the correct syntax for Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the given context, we need to map the DBpedia properties and resources to their corresponding Wikidata entities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Mapping the Occupation Property**:\n   - In DBpedia, the occupation is represented by `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/occupation>`.\n   - In Wikidata, this corresponds to `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P106>`.\n\n2. **Mapping the Bandleader Resource**:\n   - In DBpedia, the resource for \"Bandleader\" is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bandleader>`.\n   - In Wikidata, this maps to `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5280538>` and `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q806349>`.\n\n3. **Mapping the Instrument Property**:\n   - In DBpedia, the instrument is represented by `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/instrument>`.\n   - In Wikidata, this corresponds to `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1303>`.\n\n4. **Mapping the Trumpet Resource**:\n   - In DBpedia, the resource for \"Trumpet\" is `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trumpet>`.\n   - In Wikidata, this maps to `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8338>` and `<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q119621>`.\n\n### Constructing the SPARQL Query:\n\nWe need to construct a query that returns all URIs of entities that:\n- Have the occupation \"Bandleader\" (either of the two Wikidata entities).\n- Play the instrument \"Trumpet\" (either of the two Wikidata entities).\n\nHere\u2019s how the query is structured:\n1. Use `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri` to fetch unique URIs.\n2. Use the Wikidata properties `wdt:P106` for occupation and `wdt:P1303` for instrument.\n3. Use the `VALUES` clause to include all possible values for occupation and instrument.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri \nWHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 ?occ ;\n     wdt:P1303 ?ins .\n  VALUES ?occ { wd:Q5280538 wd:Q806349 }\n  VALUES ?ins { wd:Q8338 wd:Q119621 }\n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves all entities in Wikidata that are bandleaders and play the trumpet, using the mappings provided."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a SPARQL query for the Wikidata knowledge graph (KG2). The original query was for DBpedia and it found films where both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere starred. Now, I have to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER2 mapping provided. There's information on how DBpedia entities correspond to Wikidata. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe original SPARQL query starts with PREFIX definitions for dbo, res, and rdf. For Wikidata, I know the common prefix is wd, and the ontology is usually p and ps. So I'll adjust the prefixes accordingly.\n\nNext, the original query selects ?uri where ?uri is a type of dbo:Film and has both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere as starring actors. In Wikidata, the type would be wd:Q11424 (which is Film from ER2), and the property for starring is P161.\n\nNow, the starring property might need qualifiers. I remember that in Wikidata, when you use a property like P161 (cast member), you might need to specify the role or therank. So I'll include a qualifier for the role using ps:P161 and specify it as \"starring\" or maybe rank it as a main cast. Alternatively, since the original query mentions \"starring,\" perhaps using a qualifier like 'main cast' isn't necessary, but it's safer to include it to ensure we get the right results.\n\nJulia Roberts in DBpedia is res:Julia_Roberts, which maps to wd:Q40523. Similarly, Richard Gere is res:Richard_Gere mapping to wd:Q48410. So both of these should be included in the query with their respective Wikidata IDs.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the query to select films where both actors are cast members. I'll need to prefix each part correctly and ensure the syntax is right, including the use of rdf:type for the type.\n\nWait, do I need to use rdf:type in Wikidata? I think in Wikidata, the type is usually defined with wdt:P31, but sometimes rdf:type is also used. However, to be precise, using wdt:P31 for type is better because it directly refers to the type in Wikidata.\n\nSo, the structure will be:\n- ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 (film)\n- ?item p:P161 [ps:P161 wd:Q40523] (Julia)\n- ?item p:P161 [ps:P161 wd:Q48410] (Richard)\n\nWait, no, the p and ps are for qualifiers. So perhaps for each actor, I should structure it as:\n\n?item wdt:P161 wd:Q40523;\n           wdt:P161 wd:Q48410.\n\nBut that might not be sufficient because it's possible the same film has both, but the way it's structured might need to be two separate triples. Alternatively, using the someValuesFrom approach, but I think that's more complicated.\n\nI'll keep it simple for now, using two separate statements. So the query would look for items that are films and have both P161 pointing to both actors.\n\nLet me construct the query with these points in mind, making sure to use the correct prefixes and structure.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and relations from the DBpedia query to their corresponding identifiers in Wikidata. Below is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Entity and Relation Mapping**:\n   - **Film**: In DBpedia, this is represented by `dbo:Film`, which corresponds to `wd:Q11424` in Wikidata.\n   - **Starring**: The property `dbo:starring` in DBpedia maps to `wdt:P161` in Wikidata.\n   - **Julia Roberts**: Represented by `res:Julia_Roberts` in DBpedia, which maps to `wd:Q40523` in Wikidata.\n   - **Richard Gere**: Represented by `res:Richard_Gere` in DBpedia, which maps to `wd:Q48410` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Query Construction**:\n   - **Prefixes**: Use `wd` for the main entities and `wdt` for property references.\n   - **Selection**: We are looking for `?uri` to represent the films.\n   - **Triple Patterns**:\n     - Ensure that `?uri` is of type `Film` using `wdt:P31`.\n     - Include both actors with the `wdt:P161` property.\n\n3. **Final Query**:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri\nWHERE {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n         wdt:P161 wd:Q40523 ;\n         wdt:P161 wd:Q48410 .\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves films where both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are listed as cast members, leveraging the corresponding Wikidata identifiers."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to produce a SPARQL query for the second knowledge graph, which is Wikidata, to find out the capital of Canada. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the first part, the user used DBpedia to get the capital of Canada. The SPARQL query they provided used the prefix dbo for the ontology and res for the resources. It selected the URI where res:Canada has a dbo:capital relation.\n\nNow, the task is to do something similar but for Wikidata instead. I'll start by looking at the ER2 mapping provided. It has two main sections. The first maps the DBpedia resource \"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada\" to two Wikidata IDs: Q1020 and Q16. The second part maps \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital\" to the Wikidata property P36.\n\nSo, my first thought is that I need to replace the DBpedia resources and properties with their corresponding Wikidata ones. In DBpedia, the country was identified by res:Canada, but in Wikidata, entities are often referred to by their Q numbers, like Q16 for Canada. Similarly, the property dbo:capital should be replaced with wdt:P36, which is the Wikidata property for \"capital\".\n\nNext, I should consider the prefixes for Wikidata. Typically, in Wikidata SPARQL queries, we use the prefix wd for entities and wdt for properties. So, I'll need to define these prefixes at the beginning of the query.\n\nNow, structuring the query: I'll want to select the capital's URI, so I'll use SELECT DISTINCT to get unique results. The main entity is Canada, which in Wikidata is Q16, so I'll reference it as wd:Q16. The property is P36, so it'll be wdt:P36. I'll need to specify that I'm looking for ?capital where wd:Q16 is related via wdt:P36.\n\nPutting it all together, the prefixes will define wd and wdt. The WHERE clause will have wd:Q16 wdt:P36 ?capital. This should fetch all entities that are the capitals connected to Canada via the \"capital\" property in Wikidata.\n\nWait, but sometimes Wikidata can have multiple entries for the same entity, maybe due to different sources or types. So maybe adding a DISTINCT keyword in SELECT is a good idea to avoid duplicates.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the syntax is correct, especially the placement of semicolons and the use of prefixes. SPARQL can be sensitive to syntax errors, so double-checking that would help.\n\nI think that's all. Let me write that out properly with the correct syntax and prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo create the SPARQL query for Wikidata, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant Wikidata entities and properties:**\n   - Canada in Wikidata is often represented by `wd:Q16`.\n   - The property for \"capital\" in Wikidata is `wdt:P36`.\n\n2. **Define the prefixes needed for the query:**\n   - Use `wd` for entities and `wdt` for predicates.\n   - The prefix `rdfs` is often used for schema information, but in this case, it's not necessary.\n\n3. **Construct the query structure:**\n   - Select the capital's URI using `SELECT DISTINCT ?capital`.\n   - Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the triple pattern: `wd:Q16 wdt:P36 ?capital`.\n\nHere's the complete SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT DISTINCT ?capital \nWHERE {\n  wd:Q16 wdt:P36 ?capital.\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to help the user by generating a SPARQL query for Wikidata based on the given DBpedia query. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the DBpedia query is selecting soccer players born in Malta. The SPARQL query for DBpedia is:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { \n  ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/SoccerPlayer> ; \n  <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malta> \n}\n\nSo, in DBpedia, they're using the SoccerPlayer ontology and the birthPlace property to find all URIs that are soccer players and were born in Malta. Now, the user wants to replicate this query but in Wikidata, which is a different knowledge graph. \n\nI remember that Wikidata uses different identifiers for entities and properties compared to DBpedia. The user has provided a mapping between DBpedia and Wikidata entities and properties. Let's look at that:\n\nER2 Mapping:\n- dbpedia_id: http://dbpedia.org/ontology/SoccerPlayer maps to wikidata_ids: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q937857\n- dbpedia_id: http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace maps to wikidata_ids: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P19\n- dbpedia_id: http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malta maps to wikidata_ids: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q233\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the class for soccer players is Q937857, the property for birthplace is P19, and Malta is Q233.\n\nIn DBpedia, the query uses a RDF type and a property. In Wikidata, the structure is a bit different because it's based on triples where each subject can have multiple predicates and objects. So, instead of using 'a' for type, in Wikidata, the occupation or class is usually represented using the 'instance of' property, which is P31.\n\nWait, no, P31 is 'instance of', so that would be used to denote that the person is a soccer player. So, in the query, instead of '?uri a <SoccerPlayer>', we need to use something like '?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q937857'.\n\nThen, the birthPlace property in DBpedia is P19 in Wikidata. So, that part remains similar, but using the Wikidata property.\n\nPutting this together, I need to construct a SPARQL query that selects all URIs (which are entity IDs in Wikidata) where the entity is an instance of soccer player and their birth place is Malta.\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the prefix 'wd' is used for entity identifiers, and 'wdt' for properties. So, the query should be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q937857 ;\n        wdt:P19 wd:Q233\n}\n\nI should also make sure to use the correct prefixes. Typically, the query starts with 'PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>'\n\nSo, combining everything, the complete query with prefixes would include these lines to specify the namespaces.\n\nWait, but maybe the user doesn't need the prefixes explicitly if they're using the standard ones. However, it's good practice to include them to avoid confusion.\n\nSo, assembling all the pieces:\n\n- Use SELECT DISTINCT ?uri to get unique results.\n- The WHERE clause specifies that ?uri must be a soccer player (P31:Q937857) and born in Malta (P19:Q233).\n  \nI think that's all. Now, I should just make sure that the syntax is correct, with semicolons separating the properties and proper use of the prefixes.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that identifies which soccer players were born on Malta, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Corresponding Entities and Properties in Wikidata:**\n   - The class for a soccer player in Wikidata is `Q937857` (equivalent to DBpedia's `SoccerPlayer`).\n   - The property for birthplace in Wikidata is `P19` (equivalent to DBpedia's `birthPlace`).\n   - Malta in Wikidata is represented by `Q233`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT ?uri` to fetch unique soccer player entities.\n   - Utilize `wdt:P31` to state that the entity is an instance of a soccer player (`wd:Q937857`).\n   - Use `wdt:P19` to specify the birthplace as Malta (`wd:Q233`).\n\nHere is the complete SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q937857 ;\n        wdt:P19 wd:Q233 \n}\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves all entities in Wikidata that are classified as soccer players and were born in Malta."

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the DBpedia example, the query used the dbo: namespace for the ontology and res: for the resource. It selected the URI where Cameroon has the dbo:capital property. Now, since we're switching to Wikidata (KG2), I need to understand how the entities and properties are represented there.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that Cameroon in DBpedia (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cameroon) maps to Wikidata as http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1009. Similarly, the DBpedia ontology for capital (http://dbpedia.org/ontology/capital) corresponds to Wikidata's P36 property.\n\nSo, the goal is to construct a SPARQL query that asks for the capital of Cameroon using Wikidata's identifiers. In Wikidata, items are often referenced by their Q numbers, and properties by their P numbers. \n\nI know that in Wikidata SPARQL, we typically use the prefix wdt: for property statements and p: for property paths. Also, the main namespace doesn't require a prefix, so we can refer directly to Q and P numbers.\n\nPutting this together, I should select the object (the capital) where Cameroon (Q1009) has the P36 property. So the structure would be:\n\nSELECT ?capital WHERE { wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital }\n\nBut wait, in Wikidata, thefull URI for an item is http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1009. However, in SPARQL, it's common to use the prefix wd: for these entities, so wd:Q1009 suffices.\n\nI should also make sure to declare any necessary prefixes. Usually, wdt: and p: are used, but in this case, since we're directly using wd:Q1009 and wdt:P36, I need to make sure the query includes the appropriate prefixes.\n\nSo, putting it all together with the prefixes, the query should look like:\n\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?capital WHERE { wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital }\n\nThat should retrieve the capital of Cameroon from Wikidata. I think this covers both the structure and the necessary mappings from the ER2 data.\n</think>\n\nTo construct the SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find the capital of Cameroon, we first map the entities and relations from DBpedia to Wikidata. Cameroon is identified as Q1009, and the capital property is P36. Using Wikidata's prefixes, the query selects the object where Q1009 has P36.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Properties:** Use ER2 to map DBpedia resources to Wikidata. Cameroon maps to Q1009, and the capital property maps to P36.\n\n2. **Use Wikidata Prefixes:** In Wikidata, entities are referenced with `wd:` and property statements with `wdt:`.\n\n3. **Construct the Query:** Select the capital where Q1009 has property P36.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?capital WHERE {\n    wd:Q1009 wdt:P36 ?capital\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

I remember that the user provided some context that includes mappings between DBpedia and Wikidata. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the original SPARQL query for DBpedia is selecting the count of distinct URIs where the URI is of type ProgrammingLanguage. In DBpedia, that's represented by <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ProgrammingLanguage>. So, I need to find the equivalent in Wikidata.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping provided, I see that the DBpedia ID \"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/ProgrammingLanguage\" maps to Wikidata ID \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9143\". That Q9143 must be the Wikidata concept for programming languages. So, I need to use Q9143 in my Wikidata query.\n\nNow, in Wikidata, entities are usually identified by their Q numbers, like Q9143, and they have labels and other properties. To check if an item is a programming language, I think I need to use the \"instance of\" property, which is P31. So, the triple would be something like ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q9143.\n\nPutting this together, the SPARQL query should select all ?item where they are instances of Q9143, and then count the distinct ?item. So, the query would involve COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) and the WHERE clause with the instance check.\n\nWait, do I need to use any prefixes in the query? I think it's standard to use prefixes like 'wd' for Wikidata, so I should include PREFIX definitions at the beginning for wd and wdt.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should have the PREFIX statements, then the SELECT clause with the count, and then the WHERE clause with the triple filtering for items that are instances of Q9143.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final query should count all distinct items in Wikidata that are instances of programming language, which is Q9143.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata that counts the number of programming languages, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Wikidata entity for \"programming language\"**: From the ER2 mapping, the Wikidata ID corresponding to DBpedia's ProgrammingLanguage is `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q9143`.\n\n2. **Understand the property for \"instance of\"**: In Wikidata, the property `P31` is used to denote that an item is an instance of another item. So, to find items that are programming languages, we use `wdt:P31` with the object `wd:Q9143`.\n\n3. **Construct the query**: We need to count all distinct items (`?item`) that are instances of `Q9143`.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n- **PREFIX**: Define the prefixes `wd` and `wdt` to shorten the query.\n- **SELECT**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT ?item)` to count unique programming languages.\n- **WHERE**: Include the triple `?item wdt:P31 wd:Q9143` to filter items that are programming languages.\n\nFinal SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?item) AS ?count) \nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q9143\n}\n```"

Time to write the query.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Target Class:**\n   - The class of interest (cosmonauts) corresponds to the DBpedia class \"Astronaut,\" which is mapped to Wikidata's \"Q11631.\" Thus, we'll use `wd:Q11631` in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Map Nationality:**\n   - The original query filters by nationality, specifically Russia (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia`) and the Soviet Union (`http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union`). \n   - In Wikidata, Russia maps to `Q2184` and `Q159`, and the Soviet Union maps to `Q15180`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL Query:**\n   - We'll query for items (`?item`) that are instances of astronaut (`wd:Q11631`).\n   - Use the `wdt:P27` property to filter by nationality.\n   - Use `FILTER IN` to specify both possible values for nationality (`Q2184`, `Q159`, and `Q15180`).\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX WD: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX WDT: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 WD:Q11631 .\n  ?item wdt:P27 FILTER (\n    IN (\n      WD:Q2184,\n      WD:Q159,\n      WD:Q15180\n    )\n  )\n}\n# List of cosmonauts from Russia or the Soviet Union\n```\n\n</sparql>\n\nThis SPARQL query retrieves all distinct entities in Wikidata that are classified as astronauts and have a nationality of Russia or the Soviet Union."

They've provided some context with the previous query on DBpedia, so I need to use that information to construct the new query.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the ER2 mapping. It shows that \"Family_Guy\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"Q5930\" in Wikidata, and the \"creator\" property in DBpedia maps to \"P170\" in Wikidata. That means I need to use these IDs in the new query.\n\nI remember that in SPARQL, the prefix for Wikidata is usually \"wd\" and \"wds\" for the schema. So I'll start by setting those prefixes.\n\nNext, I need to structure the query to select the creator. Since the previous query used DISTINCT, I'll include that here as well to avoid duplicate results.\n\nThe main part of the query will be the WHERE clause. I'll use \"wd:Q5930\" as the subject because that's the entity for Family Guy. The predicate should be \"wds:P170\" since that's the creator property. The object will be \"?creator\" to retrieve the entity that is the creator.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the SPARQL query, making sure to include the prefixes and the correct syntax. Finally, I'll test it mentally to ensure it makes sense and should return the right results.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for KG2 (Wikidata) that answers the question \"Who created Family Guy?\", we need to use the information from the ER2 mapping provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the entity for \"Family Guy\" in Wikidata**: From the ER2 mapping, we see that \"Family_Guy\" in DBpedia corresponds to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5930\" in Wikidata.\n\n2. **Identify the property for \"creator\" in Wikidata**: The \"creator\" property in DBpedia corresponds to \"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P170\" in Wikidata.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**: We will use the Wikidata prefixes `wd` and `wds` to write the query. The query will select the entity that is the creator of \"Family Guy\" (Q5930) using the P170 creator property.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?creator WHERE {\n  wd:Q5930 wds:P170 ?creator\n}\n```\n\nThis query works as follows:\n- `wds:P170` is the direct property for \"creator\" in Wikidata.\n- `wd:Q5930` is the Wikidata entity for \"Family Guy.\"\n- `SELECT DISTINCT ?creator` retrieves the unique entity that is the creator of \"Family Guy.\"\n</sparql>"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the user translate their existing SPARQL query from DBpedia to Wikidata. They've already provided the context, including the ER mapping and the query for KG1. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding what the user is asking for. They want to find the population of Mexico City, and they have a SPARQL query set up for DBpedia. Now, they want the same query but for Wikidata. \n\nLooking at the original query:\n\nPREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>\nPREFIX dbr: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/>\nSELECT ?Mexico_City \nWHERE { \n  dbr:Mexico_City dbo:populationTotal ?Mexico_City \n}\n\nSo, the query is fetching the total population of Mexico City from DBpedia. Now, for Wikidata, I need to map the entities and properties correctly using the provided ER mapping.\n\nFrom the ER2 section, I see that:\n- Mexico City in DBpedia is mapped to Q1489 in Wikidata.\n- populationTotal in DBpedia is P1082 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the entity is Q1489, and the property is P1082. Wikidata's prefixes are usually 'wd' and 'wds' for the ontology, but sometimes people just use the full URIs. However, using prefixes is cleaner.\n\nIn the original query, they used 'dbo:populationTotal' which refers to the property in DBpedia. In Wikidata, that's 'wds:P1082'.\n\nNext, the structure of the Wikidata SPARQL query. Wikidata uses a similar structure but requires specifying the RDF type for entities. So, the query should include a triple that defines Mexico City as an instance of a city or something similar. However, the ER mapping doesn't provide that, so I might assume the entity is already correctly defined.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the population value where the subject is Q1489 and the property is P1082. The prefixes 'wd' and 'wds' are standard in Wikidata, so I'll define them accordingly.\n\nWait, should I include any additional variables or filters? Since the user just wants the population, selecting ?population should suffice. Also, in Wikidata, it's common to include a statement like ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q515, which asserts that Mexico City is a city. But since the ER mapping doesn\u2019t specify, maybe it's not necessary. However, adding it could make the query more precise. Let me think\u2026 The original query didn\u2019t include such a filter, so perhaps it\u2019s better to keep it simple and just fetch the population.\n\nBut considering best practices in Wikidata, including the type might be better to ensure accuracy. However, without the ER mapping for the type, it might complicate things. Alternatively, we can structure the query without it for simplicity, as the main goal is to get the population.\n\nSo, the final query would look like selecting the population using P1082 from Q1489.\n\nI should also ensure the prefixes are correctly defined. Wikidata usually uses 'wd' for IDs and 'wds' for properties. So, 'wd' is for the entity IDs, and 'wds' is for the property IDs.\n\nTherefore, the SPARQL query would be structured with the appropriate prefixes, select the population variable, and use the correct property and entity from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo create the equivalent SPARQL query forWikidata (KG2), we need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to their corresponding entities and properties in Wikidata. Based on the provided ER mapping:\n\n1. The entity `dbr:Mexico_City` in DBpedia corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489` in Wikidata.\n2. The property `dbo:populationTotal` in DBpedia corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1082` in Wikidata.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Define Prefixes**: We use standard prefixes for Wikidata entities and properties. In Wikidata, entities are typically prefixed with `wd:` and properties with `wds:`.\n2. **Select Variable**: We want to retrieve the population value, so we use `?population` as the variable to hold the result.\n3. **Construct Query**: We query for the entity `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1489` (Mexico City) and ask for its property `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P1082` (populationTotal). This will return the population value.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query:\n```sparql\nPREFIX wds: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?population \nWHERE \n{\n  wd:Q1489 wds:P1082 ?population\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the previous query for DBpedia was using PREFIXES for dbo and res, and it selected the creator of Batman. But now, since I'm working with Wikidata, I need to adjust the prefixes and the properties accordingly.\n\nLooking at the ER2 mapping, I see that the DBpedia resource for Batman (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Batman) maps to Wikidata's http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2695156. So, in Wikidata, the entity for Batman is Q2695156. That means in my SPARQL query, I'll need to use this identifier.\n\nNext, the creator property in DBpedia is dbo:creator, which maps to Wikidata's P170. So, instead of using dbo:creator, I should use wdt:P170 in the SPARQL query because Wikidata uses the wdt prefix for properties.\n\nI also need to set up the correct prefixes in the SPARQL query. Typically, Wikidata uses the wd prefix for entities and wdt for properties. So I'll define PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> and PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> for the direct properties.\n\nPutting it all together, I want to select the creator of Batman. So the subject will be wd:Q2695156, the predicate will be wdt:P170, and the object will be the variable ?creator. I'll use SELECT ?creator to retrieve the value.\n\nI might also want to include a label for the creator to make the result more readable, so I'll add a FILTER with a language tag, say 'en' for English.\n\nWait, actually, I forgot to include the where clause properly. It should link the creator variable to the label. So I'll add a clause where ?creator rdfs:label ?creatorLabel and specify the language as 'en'.\n\nLet me double-check the syntax to make sure everything is correct. Prefixes look right, the where clause correctly links the Batman entity to its creator, and the filter ensures the label is in English. \n\nHmm, I think that's all. So the SPARQL query should now correctly fetch the creator of Batman from Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nTo answer the question \"Who created Batman?\" using Wikidata, follow these steps to construct the SPARQL query:\n\n1. **Prefixes**: Define the necessary prefixes for Wikidata entities and properties.\n   - `wd` for entities: `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/`\n   - `wdt` for direct properties: `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/`\n   - `rdfs` for RDF schema: `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\n2. **Triple Pattern**: \n   - **Subject**: Use the Wikidata entity for Batman, `wd:Q2695156`.\n   - **Predicate**: Use the property for creator, `wdt:P170`.\n   - **Object**: Use a variable `?creator` to bind the creator's IRI.\n\n3. **Label Retrieval**: To get the creator's name in English, include the label using `rdfs:label` with a language filter.\n\n**SPARQL Query:**\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\n\nSELECT ?creator ?creatorLabel\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q2695156 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n  ?creator rdfs:label ?creatorLabel .\n  FILTER(LANGMATCHES(LANG(?creatorLabel), 'en'))\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Prefixes**: The query starts by defining the prefixes `wd`, `wdt`, and `rdfs` to abbreviate the URIs for Wikidata entities, direct properties, and RDF schema respectively.\n2. **Select Clause**: It selects two variables, `?creator` for the entity IRI of the creator and `?creatorLabel` for their name in English.\n3. **Where Clause**:\n   - The first triple pattern retrieves entities create by `wd:Q2695156` (Batman) using `wdt:P170`.\n   - The second triple pattern fetches the label of the creator, filtered to English.\n4. **Filter**: Ensures the label is returned in English for readability.\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the creator of Batman from Wikidata, providing both the entity and its English label."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to write a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) based on the given information. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original question is: \"How many people live in the capital of Australia?\" In DBpedia (KG1), the SPARQL query provided uses the resources \"dbo:capital\" and \"dbo:populationTotal\". The response explains how each part of the query is constructed.\n\nNow, looking at the Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2), I see that for KG1, \"dbo:capital\" corresponds to Wikidata's \"P36\", and \"dbo:populationTotal\" corresponds to \"P1082\". Also, \"res:Australia\" in KG1 maps to several Wikidata entities, including \"Q408\" and \"Q3960\". I believe \"Q408\" is the correct one for Australia as a country.\n\nSo, the goal is to translate the DBpedia query into a Wikidata query. In Wikidata, entities are prefixed with \"wd:\", and properties with \"p:\". The property for capital is \"p:P36\", and for population, it's \"p:P1082\".\n\nI should start by selecting the variable for population, say \"?num\". Then, I need to specify that Australia's capital has this population. So, \"wd:Q408\" (Australia) \"p:P36\" \"?capital\" would get the capital city. Then, \"?capital\" \"p:P1082\" \"?num\" would get the population of that capital.\n\nPutting it together, the WHERE clause should link Australia to its capital and then to the population. Using \"SELECT DISTINCT\" ensures I get unique results. I also need to remember the \"PREFIX\" declarations for Wikidata, which are \"wd:\" and \"p:\".\n\nWait, but sometimes in Wikidata, the actual data might be in a different form, so adding a filter to ensure it's numerical might be helpful, but the original query didn't include it. Since the original query didn't have a filter, maybe I shouldn't add it unless necessary.\n\nSo, the final query should select the population total where Australia's capital is the subject, and the object is the population number. That should answer the question.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and SPARQL Query:**\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Properties:**\n   - Australia is represented in Wikidata as `wd:Q408`.\n   - The property for \"capital\" in Wikidata is `p:P36`.\n   - The property for \"populationTotal\" in Wikidata is `p:P1082`.\n\n2. **Construct the Query:**\n   - Select the population value `?num`.\n   - Link Australia (`wd:Q408`) to its capital using `p:P36`, resulting in `?capital`.\n   - Link the capital (`?capital`) to its population using `p:P1082`, resulting in `?num`.\n\n3. **Formulate the SPARQL Query:**\n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\n   SELECT DISTINCT ?num\n   WHERE {\n       wd:Q408 wdt:P36 ?capital .\n       ?capital wdt:P1082 ?num\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis query retrieves the population of Australia's capital from Wikidata."

Let me start by understanding the given information. \n\nFirst, from the ER2 mapping, I see that North Rhine-Westphalia in DBpedia is linked to Q1198 in Wikidata. So, in the SPARQL query, I'll use Q1198 as the subject.\n\nNext, the areaTotal property in DBpedia (dbo:areaTotal) maps to P2046 in Wikidata, which is \"area.\" That means I'll use P2046 as the predicate in my query.\n\nI know that in Wikidata, quantities are often returned with their units by using the \"quantity,\" \"unit,\" and sometimes \"upperBound\" or \"lowerBound\" for ranges. Since the user is asking for the total area, I can structure the query to retrieve the main value.\n\nI should also include a prefix for Wikidata, probably using 'wd' and 'wds' prefixes for easier readability. So, I'll define them at the beginning of the query.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll select the quantity and the unit. Using OPTIONALS will help include the units even if they're not always present. The FILTER is used to ensure that only the latest and most accurate 'statement' is considered.\n\nI should test if this makes sense. Using Q1198, I'm querying for P2046, which is area. Returning the quantity and unit should give the total area. Using wikidata.org as the endpoint is correct for Wikidata.\n\nI think that covers the necessary steps. Now, I'll write the SPARQL query with these components.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the DBpedia entities and properties to their corresponding Wikidata entities and properties.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject Entity**:  \n   From ER2 mapping, the DBpedia resource `dbr:North_Rhine-Westphalia` corresponds to the Wikidata entity `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1198`. Thus, we will use `wd:Q1198` as the subject in the SPARQL query.\n\n2. **Identify the Predicate/Property**:  \n   The DBpedia property `dbo:areaTotal` maps to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P2046` (which represents \"area\"). We will use `wdt:P2046` to retrieve the total area.\n\n3. **SPARQL Query Structure**:  \n   We will use the following structure:  \n   ```sparql\n   PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> \n   PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> \n   SELECT ?tarea ?tareaUnit \n   WHERE { \n     wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea . \n     OPTIONAL { wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea . \n                BIND(REPLACE(STR(AFTER(SUBSTR(STR(?tarea), STRLEN('http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q') + 1), 0)), '_', ' ') AS ?tareaUnit) } \n   }\n   ```  \n   This query retrieves the total area (`?tarea`) and its unit (`?tareaUnit`) for North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query for KG2:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\n\nSELECT ?tarea ?tareaUnit\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea.\n  OPTIONAL {\n    wd:Q1198 wdt:P2046 ?tarea.\n    BIND(REPLACE(STR(AFTER(SUBSTR(STR(?tarea), STRLEN('http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q') + 1), 0)), '_', ' ') AS ?tareaUnit)\n  }\n}\n</sparql>\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find out how many employees IBM has. I'm not very experienced with SPARQL, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember the user provided a similar query for DBpedia. Let me look at that. The DBpedia query is selecting the number of employees where the subject is IBM and the predicate is numberOfEmployees. So, the structure is SELECT ?number WHERE { IBM ontologyURLnumberOfEmployees ?number }.\n\nNow, for Wikidata, I need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to Wikidata. The entity mapping shows that DBpedia's IBM is linked to two Wikidata entities: Q70096636 and Q37156. I'm not sure which one is more relevant here. Maybe Q37156 is the main entity for IBM since it's more well-known.\n\nNext, looking at the property mapping, DBpedia's numberOfEmployees corresponds to Wikidata's P1128. So, I should use P1128 in my query.\n\nIn Wikidata, the way to query is a bit different. The main endpoint is http://query.wikidata.org/sparql. Also, in Wikidata, the full URIs are used for entities and properties, or you can use the prefix wd: and p: for entities and properties respectively. For example, instead of writing the full URL for IBM, I can write wd:Q37156.\n\nSo, building the WHERE clause: I need to specify that IBM (wd:Q37156) has the property P1128 (numberOfEmployees) with some value. In SPARQL, that would look like wd:Q37156 p:P1128 ?number.\n\nWait, no, I think the correct way to write property in Wikidata is using the property's IRI or the prefix. I recall that in Wikidata, the property P1128 is often used as wdt:P1128 in the query. The 'wdt' prefix is for data properties, and 'p' is for the property itself in a different context.\n\nSo, maybe I should use wdt:P1128 instead of p:P1128. Let me check that. Yes, in Wikidata SPARQL queries, data properties are usually accessed via wdt: followed by the property number.\n\nTherefore, the WHERE clause should be wd:Q37156 wdt:P1128 ?number.\n\nPutting it all together, the SELECT statement would be SELECT ?number WHERE { wd:Q37156 wdt:P1128 ?number }.\n\nI should also remember to use the Wikidata endpoint, so the FROM clause would point to http://query.wikidata.org/sparql, but I think in practice, the endpoint is already set, so maybe it's optional to include it in the query.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the SPARQL query, you can specify the endpoint using the PREFIX or by setting the default graph, but in the query itself, you can just write the WHERE clause without needing the FROM if you're using the default endpoint.\n\nI'm a bit unsure, but I think the FROM clause is not necessary here. So, the query will be:\n\nSELECT ?number WHERE {\n  wd:Q37156 wdt:P1128 ?number\n}\n\nI should also make sure that it's correct to use wdt:P1128. From what I've learned, the wdt prefix is used for data properties, so it makes sense here since P1128 is a data property indicating the number of employees.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that IBM might have multiple entities in Wikidata, but in the ER2 mapping, the user provided two options: Q70096636 and Q37156. I think Q37156 is the correct and more commonly used one for IBM, so I'll use that.\n\nIn summary, the steps are:\n1. Identify the Wikidata entity for IBM (using ER2 mapping).\n2. Use the corresponding Wikidata property for numberOfEmployees.\n3. Structure the WHERE clause with the entity and property.\n4. Use the correct prefixes for entities and properties in Wikidata.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation and the final SPARQL query for Wikidata:\n\n**Step 1:**  \nIdentify the relevant entities and properties from the provided mappings. IBM is mapped to Wikidata entity `Q37156`, and `numberOfEmployees` is mapped to property `P1128`.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nUnderstand that in Wikidata, properties are accessed using the prefix `wdt:` for data properties, so `wdt:P1128` is used.\n\n**Step 3:**  \nConstruct the WHERE clause by linking the entity `wd:Q37156` with the property `wdt:P1128` to the variable `?number`.\n\n**Step 4:**  \nFormulate the SPARQL query to select the number of employees.\n\nFinal SPARQL Query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?number WHERE {\n  wd:Q37156 wdt:P1128 ?number\n}\n```"

Let me start by understanding the original DBpedia query provided. \n\nThe original query is:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { ?uri a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film> ; <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/starring> <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesse_Eisenberg> }\n\nThis query is asking DBpedia for all film URIs where Jesse Eisenberg is starring. Now, I need to translate this into a Wikidata query. \n\nFirst, I should check the ER2 mapping. It shows how DBpedia entities and relations correspond to Wikidata. The Film entity in DBpedia is mapped to Q11424 in Wikidata. The starring relation in DBpedia is mapped to P161 in Wikidata. The Jesse Eisenberg resource is mapped to Q219512 in Wikidata.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the equivalent query would select all Works (items) where the starring actor is Jesse Eisenberg. In SPARQL, this would involve using the property P161 (cast member) to link the film to Jesse Eisenberg.\n\nI need to structure the SPARQL query correctly. It would start with SELECT DISTINCT ?item to get unique results. Then, the WHERE clause will specify that ?item is a film (wd:Q11424) and that it has Jesse Eisenberg (wd:Q219512) as a cast member (p:P161).\n\nPutting it all together, the query should look like:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE { ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ; p:P161 ?actor . ?actor ps:P161 wd:Q219512 }\n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure I got all parts correctly. Using wdt for direct property access for the film type and p and ps for the cast member property with the specific actor value. This should filter all movies where Jesse Eisenberg is in the cast.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we need to translate the DBpedia query using Wikidata's entities and properties. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the main entity and properties**:\n   - **Jesse Eisenberg** is represented in Wikidata as `wd:Q219512`.\n   - **Film** is categorized in Wikidata as `wd:Q11424`.\n   - **Starring** (or cast member) in Wikidata is represented by the property `p:P161`.\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL query**:\n   - We select distinct items (`?item`) that are films and have Jesse Eisenberg as a cast member.\n   - The query structure uses `wdt:P31` to assert that `?item` is a film.\n   - It uses `p:P161` to link the film to the cast member (`?actor`), and `ps:P161` to specify that `?actor` is Jesse Eisenberg.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query**:\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item WHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ;\n    p:P161 ?actor .\n  ?actor ps:P161 wd:Q219512\n}\n```"

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to get all Danish movies. I know that the original query was for DBpedia, but I need to translate this to Wikidata now. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original query in DBpedia is selecting URIs of films that are from Denmark. It uses the ontology terms like <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Film> for the type and <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country> for the country relation, and the resource <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark> as the country.\n\nNow, I have an entity and relation mapping provided. Let's look at that. The first part maps DBpedia's Film ontology to Wikidata's Q11424. That means in Wikidata, the concept of a Film is represented by the entity Q11424. So, in the SPARQL query, I should replace dbpedia-owl:Film with wd:Q11424.\n\nNext, the country relation in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's P17. So, instead of using dbpedia-owl:country, I should use wdt:P17 in Wikidata's SPARQL syntax.\n\nThen, the country Denmark in DBpedia is mapped to two Wikidata entities: Q5257925 and Q35. I'm not sure why there are two, maybe one is more specific or an alternative. For the query, I think using the more general one, which is Q35, representing Denmark, should suffice. So, I'll use wd:Q35 in the query.\n\nPutting this together, in Wikidata, to find all films, I need to select items that are instances of Film (wd:Q11424) and have a country (wdt:P17) set to Denmark (wd:Q35).\n\nIn Wikidata SPARQL, the syntax is a bit different. I'll start with the PREFIX to define namespaces, like wd: and wdt: for better readability. Then, I'll use the SELECT DISTINCT clause to get unique items. The WHERE clause will contain the two conditions: the item is a film and the country is Denmark.\n\nI should be careful with the prefixes and ensure that the variables and patterns are correctly written. So, the query structure would be:\n- Select distinct ?film\n- Where:\n  - ?film is of type Film (wd:Q11424)\n  - ?film has country (wdt:P17) set to wd:Q35\n\nI think that's it. Let me write this out properly.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to retrieve all Danish movies, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of entity**: Use Wikidata's entity for Film, which is Q11424.\n2. **Determine the property for country**: Use Wikidata's property P17.\n3. **Set the country to Denmark**: Use Wikidata's entity for Denmark, which is Q35.\n\nThe constructed SPARQL query is as follows:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?film\nWHERE {\n  ?film wdtd: <http://www.wikodata.org/prop/direct/instance of> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11424> .\n  ?film wdt:P17 <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q35> .\n}\n```\n\nThis query selects all distinct items ?film that are instances of Film (Q11424) and have the country (P17) set to Denmark (Q35)."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find out which countries the Himalayan mountain system extends to. I have some information from the previous example using DBpedia, so I can use that as a reference.\n\nFirst, in the DBpedia query, the resource is <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas> and the predicate is <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>. The results from the ER2 mapping show that the Himalayas in DBpedia correspond to multiple Wikidata entities: Q105981852, Q26235529, and Q5451. The country predicate in DBpedia maps to Wikidata's P17, which is 'country'.\n\nSo, I think each of these three Wikidata entities represents the Himalayas in slightly different contexts. To capture all countries associated with the Himalayas, I should include all three entities in the query. Using the UNION keyword in SPARQL allows me to combine results from multiple triple patterns without duplication.\n\nNext, I'll structure the query. I'll start with the PREFIX to shorten the URIs. Then, I'll use a SELECT statement to get the distinct countries to avoid duplicates. For each Himalayas entity, I'll create a triple pattern using wd:P17 as the predicate to link to the country. Using UNION, I can include all three entities in one query.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. The triples should be enclosed in curly braces, and each triple should end with a period. The UNION operator connects the different Himalayas entities with the same predicate and variable for the country. Finally, I'll close the query and include a comment about the DISTINCT keyword to explain why it's used.\n\nPutting it all together, I should write a SPARQL query that fetches all countries from any of the three Wikidata entities representing the Himalayas, ensuring that each country is listed only once.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and relations from DBpedia to their corresponding entries in Wikidata using the provided ER2 mapping.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Resource:** In the ER2 mapping, the DBpedia resource `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas>` maps to three Wikidata entities:\n   - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105981852`\n   - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26235529`\n   - `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5451`\n   \n2. **Identify the Property:** The DBpedia property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>` maps to the Wikidata property `http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P17` (which is `wdt:P17` in shortened form).\n\n3. **Construct the Query:** To query Wikidata, we use the SPARQL endpoint and construct the query to retrieve the countries associated with all three Wikidata entities representing the Himalayas.\n\n4. **UNION Clause:** Since there are multiple entities representing the Himalayas in Wikidata, we use the `UNION` keyword to combine the results into a single query and avoid duplicates.\n\n5. **DISTINCT Keyword:** The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicate results, as the same country might be associated with multiple entities.\n\n**Final SPARQL Query:**\n\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?country WHERE {\n  {\n    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q105981852> wdt:P17 ?country .\n  } UNION {\n    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26235529> wdt:P17 ?country .\n  } UNION {\n    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5451> wdt:P17 ?country .\n  }\n}\n# DISTINCT is used to remove duplicates as the same country may be associated with multiple entities\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **PREFIX:** Not explicitly used here since URIs are specified in full.\n- **SELECT DISTINCT ?country:** Retrieves the unique country values.\n- **UNION:** Combines results from querying different entities.\n- **{ ... }:** Encloses triple patterns for each entity.\n- **wdt:P17:** Represents the 'country' property in Wikidata.\n- **Comment:** Explains the use of `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates.\n\nThis query will return the distinct set of countries associated with the Himalayan mountain system as represented in Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata to find the largest country in the world. I know that the original query was for DBpedia, and now I need to translate that into Wikidata's structure. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original SPARQL query for DBpedia. It uses the dbo:Country type and dbo:areaTotal property. The query selects the URI of countries and orders them by area in descending order, limiting the result to the top one. So, the largest country should be the one with the highest areaTotal value.\n\nNow, I need to map these DBpedia entities to their corresponding Wikidata counterparts. The ER2 mapping provided says that dbo:Country corresponds to Q6256 in Wikidata, and dbo:areaTotal corresponds to P2046. That means in Wikidata, the entity for countries is Q6256, and the areaTotal property is P2046.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the class for countries is Q6256, which is used to denote that a particular item is a country. The property P2046 stands for \"area\" and holds the area value of the entity. This is similar to how dBpedia uses areaTotal.\n\nNext, I need to construct a new SPARQL query for Wikidata. The structure of a SPARQL query involves PREFIX definitions to abbreviate namespace URIs, and then the SELECT clause to specify the variables we want. In this case, we want the item (country) and its area, but since the original query just retrieved the URI, I'll focus on selecting the item and ordering by the area.\n\nIn Wikidata, the rdf:type is expressed using instance of (P31), so to say that an item is a country, we use wd:Q6256. The area property is wdt:P2046. So, the query will select items that are of type Q6256 and have a P2046 value.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll start by defining the Wikidata prefix 'wd' and the RDF prefix 'wdt' since Wikidata uses both. Then, in the WHERE clause, the item ?item should be of type wdt:Q6256 and have a wdt:P2046 value. I'll name the area variable ?area for clarity.\n\nAfter selecting the item and the area, I need to order the results by the area in descending order to get the largest country on top. Using ORDER BY DESC(?area), the countries will be sorted from largest to smallest. Finally, I'll limit the results to just 1 so I only get the largest country.\n\nI should also make sure to use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates, even though in this case, each country is unique. It's a good practice to include it to prevent any issues.\n\nSo the final query should select the item and its area, filter for items of type Country and with an area, order them by area descending, and return just the top item. This should accurately mirror the functionality of the original DBpedia query but tailored for Wikidata's structure and syntax.\n\nI think that's everything. I've mapped the DBpedia entities to Wikidata, considered the necessary properties, and structured the query accordingly. Now, I can write out the complete SPARQL query as per these steps.\n</think>\n\nTo find the largest country in the world using Wikidata, we need to construct a SPARQL query that retrieves the country with the maximum area.\n\n1. **Identify the Wikidata entities and properties:**\n   - `dbo:Country` maps to `Q6256` (type for countries).\n   - `dbo:areaTotal` maps to `P2046` (property for area).\n\n2. **Construct the SPARQL query:**\n   - Define prefixes for Wikidata (`wd`, `wdt`).\n   - Select the item (`?item`) and its area (`?area`).\n   - Filter items that are instances of `Q6256` and have an area value.\n   - Order results by area in descending order.\n   - Limit results to the top item.\n\nThe SPARQL query for Wikidata is as follows:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT DISTINCT ?item ?area\nWHERE {\n    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .\n    ?item wdt:P2046 ?area .\n}\nORDER BY DESC(?area)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the largest country by area from Wikidata."

        "sparql_query_kg2": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2) to find Angela Merkel's alma mater. Let's start by understanding what the original query does in DBpedia.\n\nThe original query uses Angela Merkel's DBpedia resource and the 'almaMater' property to get her alma mater. Now, I need to map this over to Wikidata. \n\nFirst, I look at the ER2 mappings provided. It maps DBpedia's Angela Merkel to Wikidata's Q567. So, in Wikidata, Angela Merkel is represented by 'wd:Q567'.\n\nNext, the 'almaMater' property in DBpedia is mapped to Wikidata's 'P69'. So, instead of 'dbo:almaMater', I'll use 'wdt:P69' in Wikidata.\n\nIn Wikidata, the common way to write SPARQL queries is to use the 'wd:' prefix for entities and 'wdt:' for properties. Also, they often define the prefixes at the beginning of the query for clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to select the alma mater where Angela Merkel is the subject and 'P69' is the predicate. So, the structure of the query becomes clear. I'll also include the appropriate prefixes to make sure the query is correctly interpreted.\n\nI should also consider if I need any additional parts, like labels, but since the question just asks for the alma mater, selecting the object should suffice.\n\nFinally, I encapsulate all this into a SPARQL query, making sure the syntax is correct and all prefixes are properly declared. This should give the desired result, which is the alma mater of Angela Merkel.\n</think>\n\nTo construct a SPARQL query for Wikidata (KG2), we need to map the entities and properties from DBpedia to their corresponding entities and properties in Wikidata using the provided Entity and Relation Mapping (ER2). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the entity for Angela Merkel in Wikidata**:\n   - From the ER2 mapping, Angela Merkel in DBpedia (`dbr:Angela_Merkel`) corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567` in Wikidata. In SPARQL, this will be represented as `wd:Q567`.\n\n2. **Identify the property for alma mater in Wikidata**:\n   - From the ER2 mapping, the DBpedia property `dbo:almaMater` corresponds to `http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P69` in Wikidata. In SPARQL, this will be represented as `wdt:P69`.\n\n3. **Construct the SPARQL query**:\n   - We want to retrieve the alma mater (`?AlmaMater`) of Angela Merkel. The query structure is as follows:\n     - Select the variable `?AlmaMater`.\n     - Specify that Angela Merkel (`wd:Q567`) is connected to `?AlmaMater` via the property `wdt:P69`.\n\n4. **Include prefixes**:\n   - Add the necessary prefixes `wd` and `wdt` for Wikidata entities and properties.\n\nPutting it all together, the final SPARQL query is:\n\n```sparql\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?AlmaMater\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?AlmaMater\n}\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the alma mater of Angela Merkel from Wikidata. The `PREFIX` declarations define shortcuts for the Wikidata entity and property namespaces. The `WHERE` clause specifies that we are looking for the entity `wd:Q567` (Angela Merkel) and its `wdt:P69` (alma mater) property value, which is bound to the variable `?AlmaMater`.\n\nThe final, complete SPARQL query is:\n\n<sparql>\nPREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>\nPREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>\n\nSELECT ?AlmaMater\nWHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?AlmaMater\n}\n</sparql>"

This query is looking for the creator of Goofy in DBpedia.\n\nNow, I need to convert this query to use Wikidata instead. From the ER2 mappings, I see that the DBpedia resource for Goofy is mapped to Wikidata's Q111135, and the creator property in DBpedia (dbpedia.org/ontology/creator) is mapped to Wikidata's P170.\n\nSo, in Wikidata, the entity for Goofy is Q111135, and the property for creator is P170. In Wikidata SPARQL, I have to use the prefix wd: for entities and p: for properties, followed by the specific P number with a statement like ps: to denote the property statement. Also, to get the actual value, I might need to use a statement with pq: for qualifiers, but in this case, since it's a direct property, I just need to get the object.\n\nPutting it all together, the query should select the value where wd:Q111135 has property P170, and the object of that property is the creator's IRI.\n\nSo the query should look like SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { wd:Q111135 p:P170 ?uri }.\n\nI should double-check the syntax to make sure I'm using the correct prefixes and property notations. Wikidata's SPARQL uses wd: for entities and p: and ps: for properties, but in this case, since I just need the object, I can use p:P170 directly without any qualifier.\n\nI think that's it. Now, I'll write out the query as per the above reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo create a SPARQL query for Wikidata, we map the DBpedia entities and properties to their Wikidata counterparts. \n\n1. **Entity Mapping**: The DBpedia resource `<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goofy>` maps to `wd:Q111135` in Wikidata.\n2. **Property Mapping**: The DBpedia property `<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/creator>` maps to `wdt:P170` in Wikidata.\n\nThe SPARQL query retrieves the creator of Goofy by querying the Wikidata knowledge graph.\n\n**SPARQL Query for Wikidata:**\n```sparql\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q111135 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\n```"
